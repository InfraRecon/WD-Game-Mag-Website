            My name:
        </h1>
            <p>
                - Roberto Valentin Bliaja
            </p>

        <h1>
            Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?
        </h1>
            <p>
                - My site is a collection of games, most importantly popular games that are played by people in the world today. Not only does my website have multiple reviews for console exclusives, but it also has a blog page where stories, posts, videos and other media are accessed. In a brief description, the essential story is a collection of various games.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The structure I chose was a Magazine for a community/club of gamers.
            </p>

        <h1>
            Inspiration: State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
        </h1>
            <p>
                - When I was young, I bought and read every month a gaming magazine called NAG, which focused on popular games, future technology, and other entertainment-related media. I took inspiration from what information displayed in the magazine.
            </p>
            <p>
                - My main hobby is gaming. I love how stories and entertainment can be portrayed as games. So I gained inspiration from multiple sites such as Playstation, XBOX, Bethesda, Ubisoft and EA. The websites helped me to create designs for information and also what information should be displayed on my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Naturally, I like designing and creating, so 3D modelling software such as Blender and Game Engines always inspire me when designing UI as there are so many ways to create interfaces and visuals. The multiple examples from w3schools have helped me a lot in how I should design webpages.
            </p>

        <h1>
            Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different abilities and needs (for example those with visual impairment)
        </h1>
            <p>
                - Those on mobile devices can view the website as the content is scaled for smaller devices. Users on Desktop or laptop devices can view the website also due to scaling media.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Images and media have been compressed to minimise the amount of bandwidth needed, The Website needed an approx. of 256MB of data. After compression it only needs and approximation of 97MB - Thats more than 50%.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The websites language is English, some browsers support multilingual translation such as the chrome browser, so I had to pick a language that would be able to be translated easily.
            </p>

        <h1>
            Usability: State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.    
        </h1>
            <p>
                - I wanted my website to be available for most devices to view, including mobile devices, as there are more mobile devices than local devices per person.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Accessibilty is a top priority, especially for those with data and bandwidth caps. The website needed to be easy and fast to load , especially for high resolution images.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Languages are important, as not everyone's native language is English, especially if you're a gamer or person living in Japan. A multilingual site was a necessity, so I had to decide on a language that could be translated by the browser.
            </p>

        <h1>
            Learning: state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?
        </h1>
            <p>
                - This Module! (That was a joke yet true).
            </p>
            <p>
                - I had to learn advanced techniques of HTML and their interactions with CSS and Javascript. I mainly needed to understand the use of span, form, document type interactions, and other ways to simplify my code.
            </p>
            <p>
                - I also needed to learn different design techniques to use in HTML, such as blending and parallax backgrounds, gradients, image and local backgrounds, filters and other advanced design techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Compression and accessibility were some of the main things I needed to learn and improve. I had to compress images using compression software so they could load faster whilst also keeping their quality. I had to improve the layout for the mobile and desktop version without sacrificing quality and ease of access, done by designing UI that would suit both versions of the website in the most simplistic manner.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                - Although I did not use Handlebars.js to its full capabilities, I did however implement in some places in my website. So I had to understand and learn the syntax (fairly simple), and understand how it works with the browser effectively.

        <h1>
            Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?  
        </h1>
            <p>
                - I believe most people will find the visuals and design pleasing to look at and use.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The information Displayed is simple and not too complex.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The type of information displayed, I believe for gamers its the perfect way to keep up and explore different themes and information.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The overall implementation of my code, design, and extensions work with little to no errors.
            </p>

        <h1>
            Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?
        </h1>
            <p>
                - MORE Content, This website focuses on gaming, film and movie content can be added as these huge industries today are becoming one genre that people relate eg. Mortal Kombat.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Adding another webpage for old news for older consoles and posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                - With some more time, I would be able to identify certain designs that most people feel comfortable using. This could help improve the accessibilty and create a cleaner design for my website.
            </p>
