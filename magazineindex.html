                                    And these tools are absolutely needed, as Bloodborne’s horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends. Creature design strikes terror in many ways – enormous axe-swinging skeletons, peculiar semi-transparent childlike creatures, and subtle creepiness, like a coven of wailing, cleaver wielding hags – but each entity is well-crafted and triumphantly threatening. That’s best exemplified by the bosses, which have the power to mystify, terrify, and infuriate. I ultimately found many of those big fights much simpler than getting past the trial-and-error battles with dozens of smaller enemies I fought to reach them, but the satisfaction in each and every victory was huge.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The progression that follows those hard-fought wins is a carefully doled-out treat in Bloodborne. For one thing, the glowing pale purple lamps that serve as its version of checkpoints are scarce. Surviving long enough to reach the next point is rarely an option you can count on, but delving out of your comfort zone to find a secret shortcut back to safety brings a wave of comfort. Unfortunately, the inability to warp between these lamps without a layover back to the Hunter’s Dream (your ethereal-feeling home base) is a needless annoyance that exacerbates the issue with the extended load times.

                                <p>
                                    After arriving at a destination, nearly every careful, blood-soaked step through the consistently stunning environments reveals something new about Bloodborne’s vague and cryptic lore. Whispers and clues are everywhere, begging to be interpreted. Despite a frame rate that all too often buckles under the strain of loading new areas or heavy action, the atmosphere retains its full effect. There’s a sense that this strange and dark place is alive. You could find a subtext of criticisms on real-world concepts like faith and worship in the understated dialogue, but taking each outrageously odd story point at face value is the more enjoyable path.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Yet your personal story will be created on your own terms, as you explore the spiderweb of paths and secrets that crisscross Bloodborne’s potent world. Everything is packed with hidden meaning, and spending time speaking with the forgotten citizens of the eerily rotting city of Yarnham yields new ways to interact with the world. At one point, I spoke with a victim of these dark circumstances who gifted me a family heirloom that seemed inconsequential at the time; it wasn’t until I took the time to read its description that it suddenly became a vital tool in a battle to come. Rewards in Bloodborne come with careful examination and curious effort, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

                                <p>
                                    There’s so much to do and see and try here that I obsessed over finding every secret, which greatly extends Bloodborne’s already lengthy playtime – though that number can easily be extended in a New Game Plus, or the refreshing procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons. These areas aren’t just more of the same – they’re loaded with items that can be carried back into the main story, exclusive weapons and bosses, and the player-versus-environment replayability that the Souls series was always missing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    And though Bloodborne is mostly an isolating and solitary experience, subtle cooperative elements enhance that in fascinating ways. Spotting (non-interactive) ghostly shades of other players passing through your area, reading warnings and tips left by people who have come before, and studying reenactments of player deaths by activating prompts on the ground all serve as cautionary tales – immensely helpful in avoiding surprises that would otherwise leap out and kill you.

                                    Though these features are all mostly identical to their earlier iterations in Dark Souls, some things have improved. The best addition to the messaging system is the inclusion of emotes that spring to life like a hologram when someone reads the message. On the lowest rung of Old Yarnham, in a grimey alleyway corner, I used the available pick-and-choose word selection to lay down the message: “item waits ahead, but beware ambush,” then aimed and added the ‘point’ emote for a visual indicator to point to where a killer waited in the shadows. According to the rating system, it’s been very helpful to others, and that’s a great feeling. I saved lives.

                                <p>
                                    As far as cooperative multiplayer, Bloodborne is every bit as obtuse as Dark Souls ever was. It allows you to call for help from another player when you need it most, such as a boss fight that feels like a brick wall or a group of enemies you don’t feel confident in taking on alone, by ringing a Beckoning Bell; any players ringing a response bell in the area will warp into your world. The catch (since there’s always a catch in Bloodborne) is that at the same time, you open yourself up to invasion from hostile players that are actively seeking to hunt and kill other hunters. In a rare move of compassion, this time around From has wisely included a password-protected game feature so that you and a friend can connect deliberately, removing some of the ambiguity of anonymous cooperation.

                                    Bloodborne is an amazing, exacting, and exhausting pilgrimage through a gorgeous land that imposes the feeling of approaching the bottom of a descent into madness. Though extended load times and minor frame-rate hitches have an effect on the pacing, it’s otherwise an intensely challenging and rewarding game. There’s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh.

                                 Insomniac’s Ratchet and Clank on PlayStation 4 is one of the most charming, creative, and rewarding adventures in recent memory. Tagging along with the peppy Lombax and his stoic robotic pal as they jet across the galaxy and blow up everything in sight is an absolutely gorgeous adventure brimming with hilarious writing, beautiful worlds, and an awesome array of weapons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Though it follows the same story as the same core story beats as the 2002 original, this is far more than a remake or a remaster. Ratchet on PS4 is completely rebuilt from the ground up, pulling in some of the most successful elements of the series' later installments, while simultaneously bringing in some great new and refreshing ideas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Back in 2002, the original Ratchet attempted to capture Pixar’s magic formula of colorful worlds, expressive characters, and nuanced jokes that could be appreciated differently by fans of all ages. Cut to 2016, and Ratchet on PS4 has finally cashed in on all of those promises.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The lighting, the character models, and the vistas are among the most impressive I’ve seen in a game. It's one of those games that was hard to play for review while at my desk at work, because so many people would walk buy and linger just to ogle at the screen. Subtle touches, like the way light bounces off the reflective surface of a spaceship, or how Ratchet fidgets with his OmniWrech during his idle animation all come together to create a beautiful animated portrait.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    Possibly most of all are the insane amount of effects that flood the screen during a particularly chaotic battle. Pieces of robots scatter across the environment, your weapons crack and boom like fireworks, and all the money that falls out of your victims is magnetized towards Ratchet, creating a beautiful maelstrom of destruction. Even amidst this sensory cacophony, the game's stellar frame-rate never takes a hit.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    Alongside this is the energetic, well-written story that’s rife with character and humor that works on multiple levels. The 15-hour campaign follows some of the same whimsical, Star Wars-inspired storyline as the original game, but adds depth to characters while expanding the scope of the adventure.
                                </p>

                                    Insomniac has a superb penchant for wacky, satisfying weapons that it’s displayed in games like Resistance, Sunset Overdrive, and past Ratchet games, and here it is just as pronounced as ever. Whether it’s the Pixelizer that turns enemies into a pile of voxels, or the iconic Mr. Zurkon, whom you can once again summon to blast away enemies while delivering a slew of cheesy '80s action cliches, it’s a weapon lineup that’s full of visual surprises and humor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Aside from their variety and originality, I absolutely love the upgrade system at play here. Weapons level up as you use them, which rewards your specific play-style in a meaningful way. At the same time, I wanted to see how other weapons would similarly grow, which encouraged me to experiment with weapons I might normally pass on. Each gun also has a modifier grid you can slowly flesh out, which give you active aids like increased width for a flamethrower, or passive ones like a higher chance of item drops. I found myself playing Ratchet for "just one more hour" not only to make it to the next planet, but also because I became mildly addicted to growing and upgrading my arsenal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You’re encouraged to do that by revisiting planets you've already cleared and using new abilities to access new areas, but this leads to a disappointing revelation -- they’re empty. Mobs of varied enemies and awesome cinematic action scenes are replaced by long stretches of nothing but a scant smattering of low-level cannon-fodder. I wanted and was encouraged to go back and find all the hidden Bolts that unlock cool extras, in but I couldn't help but feel like I was visiting the set of a summer blockbuster years after the cameras had stopped rolling.

                                    While blowing up anything and everything makes up the delightful core of Ratchet, the entire adventure is peppered with a generous variety of gameplay twists. Throughout your journey, you’ll acquire boots that allow you to grind on rails, leading to some exhilarating sequences where you’re twisting and turning up the spiral of a tower, hopping from line to line while batting mines away. Likewise, once you stumble across the jetpack, you’re able to more freely explore the nooks and crannies of a world, which yields great rewards as long as you can keep an eye on your fuel gauge

                                    Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years. It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for.

                                 In amongst its frantic combat, slick parkour, and outrageous action choreography, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End achieves something wonderful: maturity. This is less a breezy lad’s tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when they’re all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dog’s leaner, more inventive predecessors.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Its 15-hour experience kicks off with focus. Uncharted 4’s story is established in a compelling handful of chapters that weave their way through different time periods with tightly directed cinematic flair. While its setup is overly familiar - Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher are attempting to retire from action-heroism and live a normal life until Nate’s presumed-dead brother turns up with an offer he can’t refuse - a strong emotional throughline is born from the characters’ struggle to reconcile their adult responsibilities with the promise of excitement they secretly crave. Uncharted 4 does a terrific job of exploring a more world-weary group of adventurers, with their concerns and musings layered throughout its quieter moments.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    These incidental conversations are a marvel. It’s here that we see characters bristle and soften, brought slowly to life with considered writing and a peerless voice cast. Performances from series veterans Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Emily Rose (Elena Fisher), and Richard McGonagle (Victor Sullivan) are as big-hearted as ever, while newcomers Troy Baker (Samuel Drake), Laura Bailey (Nadine Ross), and Warren Kole (Rafe Adler) are nicely understated in more enigmatic roles.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Uncharted 4’s companion characters never break the spell in more frantic or tense sections, either. If you choose to play stealthily, they’ll crouch down in the long grass beside you (and unlike Ellie in The Last of Us, they do an excellent job of staying out of enemy sightlines). If they’re in your way while climbing, they’ll let you clamber over them. They’re competent in gun fights, helpful in traversal, and typically witty throughout. They feel vital.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This level of polish and slickness permeates Uncharted 4. During traversal you can now reach for platforms by controlling Nate like a puppet with the DualShock thumbstick, which leads to fluid, unbroken climbing. A new 4x4 controls well over tricky terrain, and Uncharted 4’s camera worships Nate’s grappling hook, lovingly zooming out as he swings off of cliff faces to bring home a magnificent vista. Steep gravel paths (a personal favourite) send Nate slipping across cliff faces like they were waterslides.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you’re noticed, Uncharted 4’s bad guys will spring into action and distinguish themselves in combat. Open level design allows them to pull relatively intelligent moves like flanking, and they’ll rarely forget you’re there if you try to hide (while hanging off a ledge, for example, they’ll stamp on your hands). Such credible behaviour means you have to keep moving in battle; crouching behind an indestructible pillar to regain your health is no longer feasible. While shooting in Uncharted 4 is satisfying if unremarkable, enemies are now savvy enough – and thankfully less spongy – that there’s a genuine satisfaction born from each kill. It’s fun, frantic stuff
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With such strong systems at its disposal, then, it's disappointing that Naughty Dog doesn’t build more theatrical context around them. Regarding the series’ trademark outrageously choreographed action sequences, Uncharted 4’s campaign suffers from a curious lack of imagination. There are bright spots: there’s a brilliant car chase in Madagascar and a vertigo-inducing section involving clambering up a clock tower that really stand out. But otherwise the thrills here tend to be of a more predictable nature: lots of handholds breaking at the last minute, buildings coming down, an occasional easily solved puzzle in an opulent interior. It’s 2016, and after three Uncharteds (and two contemporary Tomb Raiders) we’ve seen it all before.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. A worthy thief’s end, indeed.

                                 Days Gone kicks off relatively simply: you play as a biker riding through an open-world zombie post-apocalypse, seeking answers around his dead wife and smashing enemy faces in with crunchy, weighty melee weapons. Sometimes, there are spectacular hordes of them. So far, so straightforward. Yet through its 60-odd-hour ride, Days Gone loses its focus with repetitive missions, a meandering and thematically unsatisfying storyline, and an excess of bugs and busywork. When you slow down for a minute or two, these issues combine with a dreary, uninteresting open world and add up to an uneven and mostly toothless zombie experience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a gruff biker dude traveling through a zombie-infested (okay, they’re technically virus-infected humans called Freakers, but functionally the same thing) Oregon, Deacon St. John is an endearingly gentle and sweet-natured protagonist. His gruff charm and unassuming ‘I ain’t no leader’ demeanor is mostly well voiced by Sam Witwer (AKA Darth Maul on Star Wars: The Clone Wars), aside from moments where he inexplicably yells during stealth missions and an occasional tendency to over-act in more frantic sequences.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His bike is your constant companion, and it handles well and feels great to ride – especially after several damage-absorbing upgrades and the addition of power-boosting nitrous. Drifting around a tight corner is a lot of fun, as is sailing over a break in the road. For a game that’s so centered on riding, I’m glad that developer Sony Bend nailed that fundamental mechanic.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    For the first half, this storyline at least forms a consistent emotional throughline and motivation for Deacon beyond simply staying alive, but it loses its direction in the second, where the focus shifts toward new characters and changing relationships with old ones, and I was left confused as to why I was meant to care. Of course, one cutscene played out for me entirely in slow motion, without audio, so maybe I missed it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The human antagonists, on the other hand, are as interesting as cardboard cutouts: they’re virtually all roughly sketched bad guys who are bad for bad’s sake. One, who is introduced in the later stages, feels particularly redundant, and is there purely to cause conflict rather than exist as a fully realized character in his own right.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are also dynamic events that play out through the world for you to discover. Though these aren’t as interesting as say, Red Dead Redemption 2’s encounters that were the basis for countless water-cooler conversations, I did appreciate the occasional unexpected hostage rescue situation or trap to escape from. You’re generally free to simply hop on your bike and ride away if you don’t want to bother with them, but they go some way to fleshing out the otherwise sterile world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Days Gone’s world certainly needs all the character it can get. While it’s pretty enough and full of dense forest, winding roads, and snow-capped mountains, if you look closer it’s also relatively sparse, with little world-building to differentiate one area from another and not a lot of surprises to be found in its sprawling land mass. Its gutted buildings are particularly dull, shells to house resources without much sense of history. Who lived here, and what happened to them? They left no trace, save the rare collectible note here or there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I can’t help but wish there was a more rock-focused soundtrack to really complete the biker vibe. Instead, what Deacon does have to listen to is a sort of paranoid, boot-leg radio station featuring the rants of a camp leader who has the unfortunate tendency to repeat himself, as do radio calls from your friends that often come well after you’d expect their in-game cues. In its current state, Days Gone also has a number of audio issues that range from instances like this to complete dialogue dropouts to audio syncing problems.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    Days Gone feels bloated, like a movie that goes on for an hour longer than it needs to or should’ve. It’s messy and confused, but peppered with genuinely thrilling encounters with rampaging hordes of zombies and occasionally breathless firefights. There’s a good game in here somewhere, but it’s buried in a meandering storyline, repetitive missions, and just too much obligatory stuff to do without an eye on the smaller details that could have given it much more character. Some fine tuning and editing could have removed the tedium and celebrated what makes this game unique and interesting, but Days Gone rides strictly down the middle of the dusty road and never finds its rhythm.

                                 The fact that remakes of both Resident Evil 3 and Final Fantasy 7 arrive just a week apart is pretty incredible, especially because they couldn’t be more different in their approaches as far as a “remake” goes. While RE3 is a mostly faithful modernization of its original, Final Fantasy 7 is less a remake and more a complete reinvention. It swaps turn-based combat with exciting real-time action and expands the first leg of the original story by dozens of hours – including with a bit too much filler and some convoluted new plot points. The long wait for this revival may not be a perfect reunion, but with or without nostalgia in play, it’s still a great JRPG in its own right.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, Final Fantasy 7 Remake is actually only the first in what is planned to be a series of as-yet-unknown length that will, if it’s ever completed, retell the entire story of the 1997 JRPG classic. This game only covers the events that take place in the city of Midgar, where Cloud Strife and his freedom-fighting allies battle the evil Shinra corporation that run it. That means roughly the first five hours of the original have been stretched into a campaign that took me more than 33 hours to complete, and there are still a few optional stones I left unturned.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s an odd decision that undoubtedly results in some structural problems, but also gives the city and its heroes more time to become fleshed out as interesting characters – even smaller ones like Avalanche’s Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge have time to become nuanced and compelling co-stars. This new telling regularly jumps between shot-for-shot recreations of the original, welcome expansions to existing sequences, and brand-new scenes that offer either enticing new perspective or pointlessly dull padding that frequently makes you retread previously explored areas.
                                </p>

                                    Thankfully, the guiding star through areas new and old is FF7R’s combat, which more than proves itself to be endlessly engaging across dozens of hours and against more than 100 different types of enemies. I’ll admit that I was initially sad to hear this remake wouldn’t use the original Final Fantasy 7’s turn-based Active Time Battle (ATB) combat, but the way that iconic system has been transformed into real-time brawling is exceptional. And though you only directly control one character at a time, you’ll constantly be giving orders to and swapping between two more mid-fight.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While you can hack away at enemies all you want with the square button, doing so charges up your ATB bars, which you can then use on unique weapon abilities, equippable spells, and items. Pulling up the command menu to pick one of these things slows time to a crawl, letting you comfortably pick actions for your entire party in the middle of combat – but that persistent slow creep forward adds a tension to every choice that truly reminded me of the frantic decision making the original elicited. (There is a “Classic” mode difficulty option, but all it does is automate all your actions in combat apart from ATB use, making it a strange middle ground I didn’t enjoy.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Every character also has a unique ability mapped to triangle that doesn’t use ATB – for example, Cloud can switch to “Punisher Mode” for extra damage but reduced speed, while Tifa can unleash a big finisher that’s powered up by one of her abilities. You can also dodge and guard at will, and you’ll need to do so a lot. Though it never got super challenging on Normal difficulty, there’s enough nuance to it that just mashing square to unleash flashy basic attacks won’t get you too far.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to a health bar, enemies have a stagger gauge that stuns them and increases the damage they take when full. It’s a system we’re seeing more of nowadays, but the clever twist is that every enemy’s stagger gauge fills in a different way. Sure, some of the more basic guys like Wererats and Shinra soldiers you just need to hit a lot, but others might be weak to a specific elemental magic, require you to dodge a certain attack, or cripple a body part in order to stagger them. Those differences keep combat fresh the whole way through, and I loved learning the puzzle of how to take down each enemy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That variety is a big part of why FF7R’s boss fights are so incredible, too. These cinematic showdowns are as intimidating as they are exciting, always multi-phase confrontations that rarely left me mindlessly swinging my Buster Sword. It’s incredible to see how returning bosses have been reimagined as well, with what were once throwaway creatures like the sewer-dwelling Abzu transformed into epic confrontations full of newfound personality. These bosses have unique moves to learn and avoid alongside weak points that need to be taken down in strategic order with the right moves. And the way cutscenes are woven in at pivotal moments always put a smile on my face.
                                </p>

                                    The expectations around Final Fantasy 7 Remake are sky high, and it mostly manages to deliver. Its combat is top notch, its enemy variety kept me constantly entertained, and seeing this snippet of story fleshed out with real emotional arcs and the previously hidden humanity behind Midgar filled me with pure joy. The boring RPG filler and Kingdom Hearts-esque convolution that was inserted in between did stop my ear-to-ear grin from being constant, but never long enough to kill the mood completely. That leaves this remake as one that still delivered on letting me relive (part of) a classic in stupendous fashion, while also standing as a great RPG all its own

                                Review by Lucy O' Brien - IGN
                            </div>

                            <div class="gameReview">
                                <p>
                                    There’s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I’d finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A sense of urgency is established from the get-go, as Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. The questions raised by protagonist Aloy and the primitive, feral machine-infested open world she inhabits kept me guessing throughout: what’s at the centre of it all? Although Horizon suffers from occasionally corny dialogue that belies its smarts, the broader ideas it prods at - the nature of creation, for example - are remarkably ambitious.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There’s much more flexibility to be found once Aloy’s out in the big wide world. Horizon’s combat is its most compelling feature, thanks to the variety found within 26 distinct species of animal-like machines that roam its great far-future expanse. These beasts have several weak points that can be scanned using Aloy’s Focus (a lore-friendly device that gives you Witcher-like heightened senses), and hitting different points can have different results that change the way a fight plays out.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    Send a piercing arrow into the bulging ‘cargo sac’ of a giant fire-spewing Bellowback, for example, and you'll set off a massive explosion. Down a flying, ice-shooting Glinthawk by destroying the armoured sac on its chest to temporarily freeze the bird, or shoot the cannon off the back of a tiger-like Ravager and pick it up to blast a T-Rex-esque Thunderjaw, who you only just noticed approaching from the corner of your eye during the fight. It’s breathless stuff, and there are no hand-holding tutorials telling you how to best approach the beasts, which makes for more rewarding wins
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After I learned how to fight competently, Horizon continually made me feel like a ridiculously accomplished warrior without sacrificing the vital sense that every major battle could easily result in my death, in large part thanks to the ferocity of the machines themselves. Though they patrol on set routes, even the 'herbivores' will immediately attack when you’re spotted, and will continue to scan for you if you manage to find a hiding place
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For Aloy’s part, her arsenal is largely tricked-out ‘primitive’ weaponry. Her upgradable bows and elemental-infused arrows - your primary weapon - feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time, allowing for dead-eye aiming. She also has access to a handful of more elaborate devices like the Ropecaster, which shoots out ropes to immobilize enemies, or the Tripcaster, a weapon that creates explosive tripwire traps at a range. Though these more creative weapons sound great in theory, in practice they’re annoyingly slow and fiddly when you're up against multiple threats, and I found the most challenging machines were too fast and too powerful to use them in a genuinely effective way. Fun to play around with on weaker enemies during more casual hunts, then, but far from crucial when you're up against a wall.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not that Horizon encourages you just to blindly wander into every fight and start shooting. A lot of the machines roam in packs, with larger beasts flanked by velociraptor-like sentry bots called Watchers, so if you’re not careful you can be outnumbered and devoured within seconds. To counter this, there’s generally a silent path to take: hiding in swatches of tall red grass and drawing machines in gives you a chance for a stealth kill, and if by some misfortune you’re spotted, Aloy’s Concentration skill is vital in helping you land an arrow right in that Watcher’s prying eye before you make a quick escape. It’s a shame luring specific machines away from their packs is so time-consuming, though; often simple hunts for a single animal evolve into massive fights against several types.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Alternatively, Aloy doesn’t have to do all the work herself, as she’ll discover how to override the machines’ brains in the field while exploring her world (to tell you how would ruin a wonderful surprise). Overriding has different effects depending on the machine - some become docile mounts, for example, while others will fight on your behalf, killing their own kind. As you upgrade your skill tree, these overrides can last for longer, which allows you to essentially build up a small army of loyal, vicious steeds. Watching them wreak havoc on the field from a place of safety is smugly satisfying.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.

                            </div>

                                    Shadow of the Colossus for PlayStation 4 is a stunning return to the classic that first wowed us on the PlayStation 2 in 2005. With completely redone art and spectacular lighting, it expertly captures the original’s unique beauty, awe-inspiring scope, and absolutely heartbreaking story while simultaneously fixing a handful of imperfections. The result is not only an incredible remaster, but one of the best and most beautiful games the PS4 has to offer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part of Shadow of the Colossus’ enduring legacy is in its relatively simplistic design. You explore the vast, gorgeous world in search of 16 unique, terrifying, and awe-inspiring beasts. These range from humanoid giants to airborne birds and massive underwater hydras. Though it’s never actually explained, your motivation is clear: slay them in order to restore life to a comatose woman who is clearly important to you. But while this premise is simple, the act of embarking on this six to eight-hour quest is remarkable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Riding out of the central shrine and using the beam of sunlight reflecting off your sword as a dowsing rod to find your next target is a continually satisfying way to kick off a hunt. And every time I started making my way toward a beast’s literal stomping grounds I was left stunned by just how gorgeous Shadow of The Colossus has become. From the way light drips through a forest to the swaying clumps of matted hair on a colossus to the textures on your character’s cloak, it’s leaps and bounds past most other contemporary games, to say nothing of its source material. It looks great even on a launch PS4, and even better on a Pro.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    This remaster also does a fantastic job of fixing some of the problems of the 2005 original, while completely modernizing the entire experience to our 2018 standards. The frame rate no longer buckles in the presence of a particularly massive colossus, and when you set it to performance mode on a PS4 Pro it even maintains 60 frames per second with minimal sacrifices in quality. You can see all the way to the horizon while riding across the vast, somber planes, revealing a sense of scale hidden in the original due to short draw distances. And the new control setup remaps the jump and grab buttons in a way that simply makes more sense than the strange original configuration. Combine all of this with a flexible photo mode and a handful of new Easter eggs and this remaster made me forget that I was playing a 13-year-old game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are still a handful of minor nagging issues that exist: for instance, the scope of some of the battles and your close proximity to a giant, hairy colossus means that the camera will occasionally get lost in tufts of fur and obscure your view at a crucial moment. Likewise, success in a few of the encounters relies on getting the colossus to stand in a very specific position, which can sometimes be a bit like trying to get a dog to stay in a bathtub.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But overall, the classic design of Shadow of the Colossus has stood the test of time without a trace of wear. Each of the 16 colossi are puzzles in and of themselves, and they ramp up from simple as you begin to learn the controls and mechanics, to deviously challenging and complex by the end. I love how that initial moment of awe and terror when you first see a beast is quickly replaced by curiosity; surveying a creature and learning its nuanced movements and distinctive behaviors as you map out a path to the top make it feel like you exist inside of a nature documentary. It’s this illusion that they’re living creatures that creates an internal conflict in hunting and killing them, and Shadow of the Colossus twists that knife brilliantly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Likewise, having a minimal set of tools at your disposal – only a sword, a bow, and your awesome horse Agro – means that you need to master each one in order to take down the beasts. There are some cool upgrades that can be gained by completing the optional Time Attack modes, such as stronger weapons, different colored horses, and even a parachute that aids exploration. And while none of these are necessary to defeat any of the beasts, they provide some solid incentives to replay the fantastic encounters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once you actually hop aboard a Colossus, the entire experience feeds into a fantastic sense of tension. The wonderful and evocative score swells, the creatures try to shake you off, and your grip meter ticks down as you try to find a weak point. This impending sense of dread is heightened by that last point — stamina management leads to awesome cinematic moments where I’d make it to a safe ledge just as my grip fades away. This mechanic brought to mind some of the most incredible moments of last year’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which in retrospect was clearly inspired by the original Shadow of the Colossus.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    The true definition of a classic, the gameplay and story of Shadow of the Colossus are every bit as great and emotional today as they were in 2005. This outstanding remaster skillfully enhances those qualities with improved controls, performance, and sheer graphical beauty. It remains one of the best PlayStation games ever made, and it’s wonderful that Sony has brought it back to the fore so a new generation of gamers can experience it without having to look past its aged facade
                                </p>

                            </div>

                            <div class="gameReview">
                                <p>
                                    The Last of Us is one of the rare beloved games of the past decade that not only didn’t demand a sequel, but actively seemed to resist the idea of one. Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original’s third-person action/stealth gameplay.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I can’t tell you much about some of Part 2’s best aspects, but not because I don’t want to – I’m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I’ll speak about its story in largely general terms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of Part 2’s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    From there, Ellie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us’ powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2’s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won’t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog’s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you’re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn’t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I’d watched it all unfold in a movie.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie’s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor. Taking strides forward in nearly every way, Ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made Naughty Dog’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original Uncharted on the PlayStation 3. It delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game’s mechanics while integrating a bit more of Uncharted’s greater mobility and action. But while Part 2 is a thrilling adventure, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. The PlayStation 4 has one of its best exclusives in one of the generation’s best games.

                            <div class="gameReview">

                                    At its core, Insomniac Games’ new adventure strives to make you feel like Spider-Man. And, thankfully, Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 succeeds at nearly every swing across Manhattan’s rooftops. I was left delighted at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is an excellent set of webswinging mechanics, which -- combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense sequences. Insomniac’s first foray into the realm of Marvel superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world and combat are only occasionally caught up in a web of overly familiar trappings.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Swinging around feels, quite simply, spectacular. There’s a small learning curve, but after getting comfortable with the basics, it’s nearly effortless to make Spider-Man look graceful in every swing, leap, and lunge. And man does it feel good to find the right mix of jumping, crawling, web zipping, and wall running.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I’ve spent hours just soaring around the skyscrapers of New York City, testing the momentum of my swings to find just the right point to gain an extra boost of speed, or leaping off the Avengers Tower to test how close to the ground I could fall, just to swing out in the nick of time. Similar to how God of War’s Leviathan Axe felt so good to throw around, Insomniac has found web-spun gold with Spider-Man’s swinging mechanic, enhancing it with additional moves like a focal point webzip that allowed me to turn any ledge, beam, or satellite tower into a jumping off point to continue my non-stop movement. Open-world traversal hasn’t been this smooth since Sunset Overdrive (which, not coincidentally, Insomniac also developed).
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    And, happily, no aspect of New York’s architecture can really stop Spider-Man. Discovering how a powerful, but nimble, Spider-Man tackles fire escapes, both vertically and horizontally, or watching him slip through the metal grating of a water tower is endlessly entertaining. His animations are so detailed that no matter the obstacle, I got the sense that I could truly do whatever a Spider-Man could.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That was surprisingly true of indoor locations, too. The main story missions often took me into large-scale interiors, sometimes for light puzzle solving, and occasionally for stealthy takedown scenarios. For anyone who’s played the Batman: Arkham franchise, the framework is largely the same: enter a room, avoid being detected, and use a mix of gadgets and (relatively) quiet web takedowns to take down the crowd.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These stealth scenarios perfectly highlight Spider-Man’s talents -- especially his love for designing gadgets. There’s a methodical thrill to plotting out the order I wanted to web up enemies, whether luring an enemy out toward me for a stealth takedown or by firing off a web trap that would stick them to a wall. There’s enough enemy variety (some react differently to your webbing than others, like big brutes that can’t be taken down as easily) that I always enjoyed the light bit of strategy these sections demanded, and would happily work my way through a dozen more.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, Spidey gets up close and personal with foes a lot of the time, too, making for combat that’s equally fun, if a little slow to show its true depth. At first, I found myself pretty much just punching and dodging, occasionally webbing up a foe so I could focus on a more powerful baddie. But as I unlocked more skills from Spider-Man’s skill trees and gadgets, combat became an improvisational delight. After some leveling, I could pull an enemy’s gun away and smack him in the head with it, while a previously planted web trip mine strung two other enemies together. I’d then web-zip my way to a floor above me to smack an enemy off a railing while simultaneously sending a spider drone after two more foes. That balancing act consistently delivered on the powerful and fun fantasy of being Spider-Man. To be fair, Spider-Man’s combat owes a lot to the aforementioned Arkham franchise, right down to the slow-motion crunch when you take out the last baddie in a bunch, but that template is sped up dramatically in order to take advantage of Spidey’s nimble nature.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That feeling of fluid movement only falters during boss battles. Insomniac throws in some big and exciting boss fights full of tense action. They’re sparingly involved, as many of the more fascinating setpieces of the story don’t involve one-on-one fights. But because the adventure is both front and back-loaded with boss fights, there’s an odd lull devoid of huge bouts right in the middle of the story. That’s not inherently bad, especially as a lot of great character work is done in the second act alongside those blockbuster action sequences. But because the first couple of bosses boil down to round-based pattern recognition, they felt a bit simple and rote. Unfortunately, that becomes pretty noticeable with the huge gap in major villain encounters. Still, there are some smart and fun twists in boss battles toward the end of the campaign to look forward to.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    I wanted Marvel’s Spider-Man on PS4 to make me feel like Spider-Man: To sail between the highrises of New York City, to nimbly web up hordes of enemies, and tussle with familiar, animal-themed villains. Insomniac Games’ first foray into the world of Marvel handily delivers on all of that. But what I didn’t expect from Spider-Man was to come away feeling just as fulfilled to have inhabited the life of Peter Parker. Aside from a few odd pacing issues, which momentarily took me out of the experience of being a superhero, and a world of optional missions that don’t always quite live up to the heft of the main story, Insomniac has delivered a Spider-Man story that both surprised and delighted me, coupled with gameplay that made me feel like Spider-Man nearly every step of the way. The Wall Crawler’s open world doesn’t consistently deliver the thrilling moments of its main campaign, but the foundation laid here is undoubtedly a spectacular one.

                                    Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story.

                                    Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined character, God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’ relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.

                                    God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot. Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.

                                    The setup is Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me, the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the opening hours.

                                    If you’ve played the previous games in the series – seven of them, counting two PSP games and one mobile game – you know that Kratos lived a long life of loss, triumph, and plenty of god-killing in ancient Greece. While that history certainly informs who he is now, the character we encounter here has started a new chapter, having found love, a family, and a full bushy beard in this world of Norse mythology. But he is still a stranger to this place, and is forced to rely on the son he barely connects with to decipher its languages and guide him when the swing of an axe or the imprint of his boot on an undead foe won’t do the trick
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That relationship, and how it evolves and changes over the course of the story, is one of God of War’s most captivating qualities. Here are two people with demonstrably different personalities, one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked as they come, both grieving over the same woman in different ways. Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to him mostly as “Boy,” and rarely making eye or physical contact with him. (He will, of course, unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone who threatens his son, which appears to be the only way he knows how to express affection.) Kratos’ uncertainty of how to relate to a boy he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to watch.

                                <p>
                                    Of course, Spidey gets up close and personal with foes a lot of the time, too, making for combat that’s equally fun, if a little slow to show its true depth. At first, I found myself pretty much just punching and dodging, occasionally webbing up a foe so I could focus on a more powerful baddie. But as I unlocked more skills from Spider-Man’s skill trees and gadgets, combat became an improvisational delight. After some leveling, I could pull an enemy’s gun away and smack him in the head with it, while a previously planted web trip mine strung two other enemies together. I’d then web-zip my way to a floor above me to smack an enemy off a railing while simultaneously sending a spider drone after two more foes. That balancing act consistently delivered on the powerful and fun fantasy of being Spider-Man. To be fair, Spider-Man’s combat owes a lot to the aforementioned Arkham franchise, right down to the slow-motion crunch when you take out the last baddie in a bunch, but that template is sped up dramatically in order to take advantage of Spidey’s nimble nature.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their dichotomy plays out in stirring, realistic moments throughout the story. I was surprised by how often I saw myself in both Kratos and Atreus’ well-worn shoes. I’ve told important people in my own life some of the very things they say to each other, and I’ve thought (but been too afraid to speak aloud) many others, making God of War’s relationships feel real and cuttingly honest. Other games have tackled parent-child relationships, but I can’t remember a father-son dynamic so successfully developed and used to ground a fantastical adventure.
                                </p>
                                <p>    
                                    I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.

                                        After the past three years of cryptic and confusing teaser trailers, the question on everyone’s lips has been, “What exactly is Death Stranding?” Well, now we know, and the answer is… complicated. The first game from famed designer Hideo Kojima since his dramatic departure from publisher Konami and his long-running Metal Gear franchise is a boldly inventive slab of sci-fi, fastidiously crafted to host to some of the most breathtaking sights I’ve ever witnessed in any medium – video game or otherwise. It’s also a cross-country crawl that frequently finds itself mired in an exhausting amount of inventory management, backtracking, one-note mission design, and unprecedentedly arduous travel. It’s evident that Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions have worked extremely hard to build Death Stranding, but it’s also painfully clear that they expect us to match their determination in order to fully enjoy it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The “Death Stranding” in question is the name given to a cataclysmic event that only small pockets of humanity, the Monster Energy Drink corporation, and an apparently universally accepted Facebook-style social status system have survived. Since the Death Stranding, natural wildlife has been wiped out and rain has transformed into “Timefall”, a deadly form of precipitation that instantly ages everything it touches. Lurking within each downpour are the BTs (“Beached Things”), paranormal entities who prey indiscriminately on survivors, leaving society confined to the safety of subterranean shelters.

                                        You are Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), a post-apocalyptic postman with a ghost-detecting baby strapped to his chest named BB who, like most infants, is as adorable as he is insufferable. Sam’s quest is certainly a compelling one; to reconnect the isolated remnants of civilisation by completing an endurance-testing sequence of delivery jobs from one city to the next, earning the trust of their citizens, and bringing them back online in the government’s “Chiral Network” as he makes his pilgrimage west across North America.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        Sam is allied in his pursuit by a quirky cast of characters with quirkier names like Heartman and Die-hardman, and opposed by Troy Baker’s wonderfully maniacal villain Higgs, who has an appetite for both licking faces and chewing scenery. Sam has additional motivation to undertake his epic expedition: his sister Amelie is held hostage by Higgs on America’s westernmost edge, a destination appropriately called Edge Knot City.

                                        It’s definitely an intriguing story setup, but if you think that playing the role of a courier makes it sound as though Death Stranding could be one continent-spanning series of glorified fetch quests, it’s because that’s exactly what it is. The vast majority of its 70 main story missions are structured in the same way as the optional side missions we’ve all run in countless other open-world games. With the exception of certain tutorial missions which introduce the basics of the combat system, boss fights, and a handful of other combat-oriented diversions, advancing the plot in Death Stranding amounts to taking item X from location A to location B, over and over again. Sounds pretty repetitive, right? Well, the good news is that there are also side missions in Death Stranding. The bad news is that these side missions are also fetch quests, undertaken mainly to unlock additional items or customisation options.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What makes the repetitive objectives somewhat bearable is that the scorched landscape of Death Stranding is staggering in scale and rich in detail, to the point that initially I wanted to slow down and pore over every inch. And it’s just as well, because I wasn’t really given any say in the matter; the opening hours are so ploddingly paced that it makes the whole thing seem like a personal attack on the speedrunning community.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       We’re all accustomed at this point to walking through vast game environments carrying an arsenal of weapons and items – that’s a description that could define anything from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Grand Theft Auto V and just about everything in between. But Death Stranding turns that routine into a grueling exercise in frustration thanks to what is possibly the most aggravatingly literal inventory system ever conceived in a video game. With rare exception, every piece of cargo, weapon, ammunition and tool you pick up has its own physical presence on Sam’s body, and its own heft, all managed by an incredibly fiddly inventory menu.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Of course, the concept of inventory weight limits in video games is not new or unique, and I’m traditionally a bit of a role-playing game packrat who’s prone to becoming over-encumbered and forced to shed superfluous items or stubbornly walk slowly back to town, on occasion. But Death Stranding takes that idea to exhausting new extremes. Not only does Sam’s personal inventory and cargo very easily become a comically oversized Jenga tower of flight cases teetering on his back, but it also makes the act of taking Sam for a short walk up a slight hill feel more like trying to push a wheelbarrow full of bricks up a flight of stairs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        Certain landmark games in recent years, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Red Dead Redemption 2, have managed to successfully tread the line between the rigidity of realism and the exhilaration of pure escapism. But much like its stumbling protagonist, Death Stranding just can’t consistently get the balance right despite possessing equally lofty ambitions and countless inventive ideas. There is a fascinating, fleshed-out world of supernatural science fiction to enjoy across its sprawling and spectacular map, so it’s a real shame that it’s all been saddled on a gameplay backbone that struggles to adequately support its weight over the full course of the journey. It’s fitting that Kojima Productions’ latest is so preoccupied with social media inspired praise, because in some ways I did ‘Like’ Death Stranding. I just didn’t ever love it

                                        Infamous: Second Son is, in many ways, a large step away from the comic-book roots of its predecessors. Don't misunderstand – Second Son is very much an open-world superhero action game first, and an excellent one at that. Its flashy powers look and feel great in battle, and that’s really what games like this are all about. But I didn't expect to enjoy the weightier, more realistic tone of the characters as much as I do. It’s a change that initially surprised me as fan of the franchise, but one that ultimately pays off. Despite failing to believably marry the player's moral choices with the protagonist's own sense of right and wrong, Second Son hits some big high notes in both character interaction, and most importantly, open-world gameplay.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It didn’t take long for Second Son's remarkable lighting to leave me staring slack-jawed at my screen. The power of the PlayStation 4 is evident in every street-side puddle reflection and in every swirling tuft of smoke that left my flaming hands. The city of Seattle is beautifully and diversely realized, but it never looked better than when I was blowing everyone and everything around me to bits. Serene city streets turn into fiery disaster zones with gleeful regularity, and both the before and after are great to look at, despite occasional stutters when the effects get out of hand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While high production values are often a smokescreen for weak characters, Second Son succeeds here, too. Troy Baker’s motion-captured performance as our new Conduit, Delsin, remains believable whether he’s being a snarky, reckless jerk, or a plucky, bohemian do-gooder. He’s not universally likable, but the chemistry he has with his conservative, law-defending brother makes for some absorbing familial banter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        Delsin is a young man who, like so many others, is filled with equal parts anger and idealism, and the fact that he wields such overwhelming destructive power makes that inner conflict tense, and interesting. Sure, it’s well-covered territory, but Baker imbues it with a charm, and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey or overwrought. Add in the icy, iron-willed villain Brooke Augustine, and the result is a conflict that boils to a genuinely affecting climax.
                                    </p>

                                        Sadly, the rest of the cast isn’t as well-utilized. Supporting characters like the immediately interesting Abigail “Fetch” Walker are quickly introduced and brushed aside, with limited involvement outside of the two or three-mission-long arc that pertains to them. While Second Son’s individual beats and characters are well executed, the plot that strings them all together is frustratingly straightforward and limited in scope, depriving the bit players of the chance to make a meaningful impact on the core conflict.

                                        Skill trees offer more options than previous Infamous games, allowing you to either concentrating on one power or split your resources between multiple paths, and the unlockable powers differ based on your moral alignment as well. An evil neon user for instance, can make targets explode into novas of pure energy, causing chain reactions that can obliterate groups of civilians in seconds, while a benevolent neon user can slow time to a crawl to carefully incapacitate foes one by one with a series of exacting attacks. Not only does this variety keep combat fresh, but it creates a strong incentive to replay and experiment with different combinations.

                                       The streets of Seattle are flush with random karma opportunities and predetermined side missions, so you never have to look far for an opportunity to put your powers to good (or not so good) use. Downing mobile D.U.P. command centers was a particularly rewarding venture, offering up some of the most steeply pitched firefights, and doling out big skill point rewards upon completion. I happily lost hours wandering around and taking the city back district by district, becoming ever more powerful as I went.

                                        Something that sticks out even more however, is the state of the morality system. The red vs blue decision making comes off as woefully outdated, and disconnected from Delsin’s personal motivation of healing his injured tribemates. There’s nothing in the story that suggests that he’d ever be interested in killing innocent civilians, or that his police officer brother would be okay with it if he did, and yet you’re clearly incentivized to murder everybody you see if you want to make the most of your evil playthrough. Extremism is always rewarded with more power, and as such, there’s never a reason to partake in evil actions when you’re trending good or vice versa. This essentially takes moral decision making out of the equation, which is sorely disappointing for a game that attempts to place choice front and center.

                                        Open-world superhero action games are about freedom and empowerment, and in these regards, Second Son is really impressive. Seattle is a big, beautiful playground for you to stomp around in with a set of devilishly fun and powerful toys at your disposal. It plays great, and it looks even better, but its advancements also beg it to be held to a higher standard, one that its overall story and morality systems struggle to reach

                                    Review by Tarryn Van Der Byl - IGN
                                </div>

                                <div class="gameReview">
                                    <p>
                                        Like Skylanders or Traveler's Tales LEGO games, Knack is a fairly straight-ahead brawler with a visual charm that will appeal to younger gamers. As you dig into its design, you'll initially be wowed by the prospect of Knack's promise of changing the main character's scale. Moving from tiny Knack to big Knack as you progress through the levels adds a wonderful sense of scale. Unfortunately, none of Knack's strengths are enough to overcome its confused tone and an overly restrictive design that ensures you're never anywhere the designers don't want you to be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       The best and most interesting part of Knack is the character's ability to grow as he accumulates additional relics. As Knack takes damage, he loses relics, which makes him smaller and more vulnerable. He can reclaim those relics, and increase in size, mostly by busting open crates scattered throughout the levels. The bigger Knack can not only take more damage, but also has stronger attacks and has a much longer reach.  Some of the more extreme changes in scale also give you a tremendous sense of perspective in power. Walking over, sometimes literally, the tiniest enemies as a giant version of Knack is one of it's finest moments.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That transition where you suddenly find yourself able to wade through any and all opposition is one of Knack's best and most reliable payoffs, but even that's sometimes spoiled by enemies that can kill you in one-shot and tedious end bosses. The standard for success shifts from doing things intelligently and creatively in the early parts, to doing things perfectly and predictably towards the end.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        I love the concept of managing your speed, size, and strength as actual resources and there's loads of potential for intriguing dilemmas where you need to risk those assets to acquire even more. Unfortunately, whether you're big or small in this game is more dependent on what the designer wants than on your own choices and actions. While small variations in size are generally tolerated, nearly every level decides just how big or small you're going to be. Whether you're trading in all your extra relics to open a door at the end of an early level, or opening up a giant box of relics just prior to a late-game boss fight, developer SCE Japan seems scared to let us be in control of too much.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This disappointment also applies to some of the alternate materials Knack can absorb. It's great to build a Knack out of mirrors, or ice, or flaming logs, but those elements are only ever available in specific situations where they're the only answer to the problem in front of you. As you play, you'll unlock special alternate versions of Knack, such as a vampire Knack who has to defeat enemies to offset a steady and persistent decline in relics. It technically adds a bit to the replayability to try levels as an alternate version of Knack, but not enough to keep bringing us back after that initial playthrough.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Most of your time in Knack will be spent fighting and the range of enemies is generally satisfying, with each specific enemy type requiring a slightly different approach. Some jump and land with massive area attacks, others shoot waves of fast-moving projectiles, and still others are protected behind giant energy fields. The combination of enemies, particularly when one is a ranged fighter and the other likes to get close in, can also make for some tense tactical fights. Outside of a few special moves, there's really only one attack button, but it's varied based on how big you are, who you're fighting, and how close you are to them.  You can attack while jumping to create a sort of invincible TMNT-style attack that will keep you alive through many a trouble.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Sony calls Knack a platformer, but there's really very little exploration or environmental challenges. Sure, there are some jumping sequences and traps, and the ever-present secret rooms, but the succession of fighting areas are small with one obvious entrance and one obvious exit, and it's just lather, rinse, repeat as you move from enemy to enemy. You'll occasionally be allowed to use other materials to build Knack – mirrors for instance can help get past security systems – but their use is always obvious and mandatory, so the player isn't really involved at all. What makes this particularly confusing is when the weak and puny humans take alternate routes to the end of the level without any clear story reason why you didn't just go along with them and avoid all the trouble in the meantime.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are other choices that disengage the player. There are loads of short transition cutscenes where Knack jumps off a ledge, or climbs over a low wall, which is all stuff the player is usually doing anyway, so it's jarring to have the game wrest control away just to show you doing something you've already done a dozen times already. Worse are the cutscenes that show Knack doing something spectacularly cool, like destroying a munitions plant, that feel like they're cheating the player out of the payoff for an entire level.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        Playing Knack is like watching a dull movie on a plane – it's tolerable if all you want is a way to pass the time, but it's not something you'd seek out for its own sake. I finished in about 11 hours and, challenges, co-op, and secrets aside, there's just not much here worth recommending. Sure, some individual elements show potential, particularly when the scale of the encounters changes as Knack grows, but it never moves beyond playing it safe with the concepts or the characters.
                                    </p>

                                    Review by Lucy O'Brien - IGN
                                </div>

                                <div class="gameReview">
                                    <p>
                                        It’s a testament to the breadth of Quantic Dream’s branching storylines that I felt terribly guilty as the credits rolled after my second playthrough of Detroit: Become Human, as I’d played against my personal moral compass to test how far I could push the story’s exploration of the morality of artificial intelligence. This was very much the opposite of my mostly peaceful first run, and Detroit obliged my wickedness to a surprising degree, leaving a trail of bodies of those who had previously survived in my wake. And while it never seems to know when enough heavy-handed expositional dialogue is enough, Detroit: Become Human manages to be a frequently moving melodrama that bends to your choices with meaningful results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Each of those playthroughs took around 10 hours to complete, and during that time Detroit’s pace rarely lags thanks to the deft juggling act it performs, alternating between three android characters across multiple chapters: Kara, a housekeeper who must care for a little girl named Alice, Connor; a prototype police model whose assignment is to round up ‘deviant’ androids, and Markus; a carer model who believes androids should share equal rights with humans.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The trio of performances is excellent. Bryan Dechart is delightful as Connor thanks to his deadpan innocence, which makes for a great foil against the whirling dervish of his cynical partner, Clancy Brown’s Lieutenant Hank Anderson. Valorie Curry brings quiet strength to Kara, and excels at selling her love for her ward, Alice, who is quite possibly the least charismatic video game child to have ever existed. Jesse Williams employs all of his dreamy Grey’s Anatomy warmth as Markus and is never unlikeable, no matter how you choose to play him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        Based on your choices, you can change their personalities and the tone of their individual stories. In my first playthrough, for example, the relationship between a humble Connor and the android-hating Anderson played out like a knockabout buddy comedy. In my second, I let Connor’s ambitions take over, and his story was of a different genre.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Though Markus appears to fundamentally remain endearing no matter what you do (unlike Connor, who really can be played as a hero or villain), there’s a tug-of-war going on within him that throws up some of Detroit's most interesting moral quandaries. Kara’s story seems less tonally flexible but is the quietest and most intimate, which provides a welcome contrast to all the running and explosions you can opt into in the other two stories.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the most part, supporting characters adapt to the way you choose to play, but there are occasional misfires. When I played as ‘nice’ Connor, for example, Anderson was far too aggressive toward him to be believable. When I played as ‘mean,’ or even ‘indifferent’ Connor, his fury made a lot more sense. At one point, Markus gained a lover very abruptly, and I felt I’d missed a slow burn somewhere. It’s noticeable when your choices feel they’re going against the grain of a more robust story.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       I found all three of Detroit’s central characters to be dramatically interesting, which meant putting them in compromising situations – or worse, killing them – was a real fear throughout. It’s testament to the writing and performances that I found making decisions “just to see what would happen” teeth-clenchingly hard.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For me, this is the biggest draw of Detroit. One playthrough really isn’t enough to see what it has to offer, and characters and world-building are interesting enough that it was a pleasure to go back to see what I’d missed in scenarios that are deceptively complex.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        Detroit: Become Human is a poignantly pulpy interactive sci-fi drama where your choices can impact events to a greater and more satisfying degree than in most games of this type. Though I wish its story had been handled with a softer touch, especially considering the subtlety that can be conveyed through its tech and performances, its well-written and acted central trio were vital enough to me that I found myself feeling genuine distress when they were in danger and a sense of victory when they triumphed. Most importantly, Detroit offers a multitude of transparent branching paths that entice further playthroughs, and choices have a permanence that raise the stakes throughout.

                                    Review by Mitchell Saltzman - IGN
                                </div>

                                <div class="gameReview">
                                    <p>
                                        In prep for this review I dusted off my PlayStation 3 and spent about a week replaying through the original 2009 Demon’s Souls. My main takeaway from that experience was, “Man, as fantastic as this game is, it feels old.” And I don’t just mean graphically: you can only roll in four directions, character controls feel loose, and just overall, there’s a lot of jank. But Bluepoint – the team that so expertly remade Shadow of the Colossus in 2018 – has addressed just about all of those major issues and more in the absolutely gorgeous PlayStation 5 remake, resulting in a game that feels much tighter to control and one that brings FromSoftware’s neglected original Souls game back to the forefront, reminding us what a strong foundation the Dark Souls series was built upon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       Like the rest of the Souls series, the appeal of Demon’s Souls is that it’s an action-RPG that prides itself on difficult, cerebral, and methodical combat, as well as extraordinarily deep character build customization. In combat, every action poses a risk, whether it’s committing to an attack and leaving yourself vulnerable in the start-up and recovery of it, or committing to defense and sacrificing a portion of your stamina to avoid taking damage. Rather than relying mostly on reflexes, Demon’s Souls relies more on making smart decisions both in and out of combat, and making the right decisions in order to overcome its many tough challenges feels incredibly rewarding in ways few other games can match.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Demon’s Souls may be the game that kicked off the Souls subgenre of action-RPGs, but it is the ways in which it’s different from the Dark Souls games that really make it stand out. The biggest is that rather than being one contiguous open world, Demon’s Souls is split into five isolated worlds, each made up of three to four sublevels, each offering their own unique rewards and challenges. The thing I love so much about this structure is how easy it becomes to just pack up, leave, and try out a new area if you find yourself struggling in the one you’re currently in. Each level is difficult, but in very different ways, and never for reasons as simple or as boring as the enemies simply just being stronger.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        World 1 is tough because you frequently have to contend with an obnoxious dragon that spends its whole day roasting each of the bridges you need to cross in order to proceed; World 2’s enemies are resistant to most damage types outside of piercing; World 3 is a labyrinth that’s easy to get lost in and is guarded by tough mind flayers that can kill you in just one or two hits; World 4 has highly aggressive skeletons that are also resistant to most weapons outside of maces and hammers; and World 5 has a ton of enemies that are easy to kill, but have a nasty habit of swarming you with rapid hits and wild attack patterns. Not to mention the whole “lake of poison” thing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What’s clever about this is that Demon’s Souls’ structure makes every playthrough feel different because you’re able to approach each world in new ways. For my first playthrough, I went with a magic-focused build and went to world 3 first so I could stock up on magic-replenishing consumables and unlock the NPC that grants access to the most powerful spells. But in my second playthrough with a more dexterity-driven character I bounced from world to world, picking up useful items and gear from each one before committing to beating any of them. It’s this flexibility that makes Demon’s Souls so distinctive among the Souls games.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Demon’s Souls also features some of the most memorable bosses of any of FromSoftware’s games, and certainly some of most mechanically interesting ones. Many feel like experiments to really push the limit of what a boss could be; of course, not all are successful. The Dragon God was a disappointingly gimmicky boss fight in 2009, and annoyingly it’s just as bad in the PS5 remake. But others, like the emotional and story-driven battle against Maiden Astrea, or the epic fight against the Storm King that has you picking up a special weapon to shoot giant slicing wind attacks at the godforsaken manta rays that had been making your life a living hell for the last three hours, are absolute classics.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       All of this is true for Bluepoint’s remake, which largely stays true to the spirit of the original Demon’s Souls, both for better and for worse. Not all of the ways Demon’s Souls differentiates itself from the rest of the Souls series are positive ones. Demon’s Souls is exceptionally grindy in often frustrating, time-wasting ways. If you run out of health-restoring grass, you’ll need to either farm it by repeatedly killing specific enemies in specific worlds that drop it, or you’ll need to farm souls (that you could have used to improve your character) and purchase it from a merchant. Weapon upgrading is also needlessly convoluted, with 16 different types of upgrade materials to find and make sense of, and almost every weapon type requiring different materials in order to upgrade them. Dark Souls addressed both these issues with the introduction of Estus Flasks and a simplification of the weapon upgrade system, and going back to how it used to be made me remember how much of an improvement Dark Souls was in those regards.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I’ve always kind of been lukewarm on Souls multiplayer, and Demon’s Souls is no exception. My attempts in trying to get summoned in co-op were met with a ton of waiting and very little payoff – especially since without the covenant system added in Dark Souls, there’s little incentive to offer your help outside of the fuzzy feeling in your belly that you get for doing a good deed. My one success in getting summoned for PVP didn’t fare much better as I got summoned for the Old Monk boss battle, only to have it end abruptly when the player I invaded never even made it to the door. After that, I simply lost the will to sit and wait for multiplayer in general unless I was coordinating with a friend.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>    
                                        Bluepoint’s team had the unenviable task of remaking an 11-year-old game with a cult following and making it look – and play – the part of being the very first game developed from the ground up for this current generation of consoles. And that’s exactly what they did. Demon’s Souls is breathtakingly gorgeous and plays significantly better than it did on the PS3, not only thanks to the graphical power of the PlayStation 5, but because of smart quality-of-life changes and light touches that modernize some frustrating aspects of the original, without ever sacrificing the relentless challenge, puzzle-infused boss battles, and style that made it such a landmark game in the first place.

                                        Miles Morales may just be finding his footing as a superhero, but his first solo game proves developer Insomniac has comfortably hit its stride as it converts its stand-alone hit into a series. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a flashy starring debut for Miles, telling as engaging a story as the original Marvel’s Spider-Man while simultaneously improving upon pretty much every minor gripe I had with that already great game. It may be smaller overall, but every facet of it feels more essential: the incredible swinging mechanics, storytelling, and animation of Peter Parker’s adventure return, joined by meaningful updates to side missions, Miles’ flashy new moves, and the captivating spirit of New York City
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        While it can be played on PlayStation 4, this is a gorgeous introduction to the PlayStation 5. Miles Morales takes advantage of improved lighting and particle effects to make this former New Yorker achingly miss the city I once called home, and swinging feels even better at 60fps than at 30.
                                    </p>

                                        Marvel’s Spider-Man established Miles’ role alongside Peter Parker, and this solo outing makes it clear just how much room there is in Manhattan for multiple Spider-Men to shine. Actor Nadji Jeter returns to the title role and gives the newly heroic Miles a sincerity, heart, and excitement that stands tall alongside other depictions out there – from the Oscar-winning Into the Spider-Verse animated movie, to the original Brian Michael Bendis/Sara Pichelli comic run, and the ongoing Saladin Ahmed comic arc. This version stays true to Miles’ best stories in other mediums – mostly, he just wants to do right by Peter, his family, and his friends – while also making this take on the character feel fresh with something new to say.

                                        That, in part, comes from Miles discovering his way around his new home neighborhood of Harlem, both in and out of the suit. Spider-Man: Miles Morales follows in the smart storytelling footsteps of the original game (and many of the best Spider-Man stories) by making sure the events of life underneath the mask come head-to-head with the webhead’s trials and tribulations. And while on a gameplay level you’re free to explore the full map (which returns largely unchanged from Marvel’s Spider-Man) much of the story itself is rooted in or inevitably returns us to Harlem.

                                        Peter had his apartment and Doctor Octavius’ lab, but his connections to the city often boiled down to specific characters like Mary-Jane or villains like Doc Ock and Vulture. Miles, on the other hand gets to keep coming back home as a teenager living with his mom during the holidays would. We get to know his whole apartment, as well as the neighboring blocks around him as familiar shopkeeps pop up in side missions and the main story. And with militaristic tech conglomerate Roxxon building a new plaza HQ in Harlem, this welcoming home neighborhood becomes the center of an engaging struggle as it fights to maintain its identity in the face of corporate takeover.
                                    </p>

                                        Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not be quite as packed with content as the original, but it stands out as an essential story in Insomniac’s Spidey Universe. It earns its spot as a fantastic follow-up, telling a wonderful Miles-specific story while improving upon the fundamentals of the first game with distinctive moves and enemies. And it’s an excellent way to break in your new PlayStation 5; it looks spectacular, loads fast, and makes fun use of the DualSense controller, the directional audio, and more. But regardless of which generation you play it on, it’s a worthy followup to one of the best superhero games ever made.

                                        The adorable Astro’s Playroom may have stolen people’s hearts at the launch of the PlayStation 5 (no doubt in part thanks to it coming along for free), but any 3D platformer fan would do well to not leave Sackboy: A Big Adventure locked in the toybox. This spin-off (which is available on PS4 as well) is relentlessly charming, bringing creative level ideas to a familiar format with a focus on co-op play, even if it lacks the same precision and depth of the most-loved games in the genre.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        While Sackboy may have been cut from the cloth of the LittleBigPlanet games before it, A Big Adventure feels far closer to the likes of Super Mario 3D World, both in structure and design. Levels are generally wide-pathed, isometric dioramas for you and up to three friends to run all over, grabbing point bubbles, beating up baddies, and hunting for collectibles as you do. It also drops the level editor or community sharing that have been iconic to the LittleBigPlanet series, instead focusing on telling a simple story about Sackboy trying to save Craftworld from the evil Vex.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The story is a cute if generic tale, but Sackboy’s sense of style and presentation is intoxicating – a nonstop slew of fun, feel-good stages made out of cardboard cutouts and other household objects. It’s all just so dang charming, and it was only the occasional frustration of a missed jump caused by an odd camera angle or unexpected landing behavior that stopped me from smiling the whole time. World themes range from yeti-filled temples to futuristic rocket labs that have you walking around on giant, interactive touchscreens, but they all share enough stylistic elements to gel into an eclectic but cohesive whole.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        A huge part of their charm comes from Sackboy’s incredible music. That includes its original score, clever remixes and reworkings of recognizable classics (you might find yourself unexpectedly noticing the melody of Madonna’s Material Girl in the middle of an otherwise orchestral track), as well as its handful of explicitly music-centered levels. The latter reminded me of similar stages in Rayman Legends, having you jump and fight to the beat of songs like Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk – although, while they are undoubtedly a blast, these levels not being on rails like Rayman’s makes their use of those songs a little more repetitive if you’re taking your time to collect everything.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        On that note, it’s a real shame that Sackboy doesn’t support online co-op at launch. That’s reportedly coming before the end of the year in a free patch (and I was able to at least simulate online co-op using the PS5’s limited but fairly impressive Share Play option), but it still feels like a crucial missing feature for a game this inherently about playing with others. Thankfully, the local co-op that is here at least works great, allowing players to drop in or out even mid-level and giving each profile their own inventory of costumes to collect and customize.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        A Big Adventure is a lovely spin-off of LittleBigPlanet that’s filled with charming sights and sounds alike. Its level designs are adorable and creative, really shining in co-op but still entertaining when played alone. Its platforming can occasionally frustrate, falling short of the precision and nuance needed to really make it stand out from other games like it, but the feel-good vibe that permeates every corner of its crafted world still makes it a joy to play.
                                    </p>

                                        Ever since Assassin’s Creed started leaping from ancient Jerusalem to renaissance Italy to colonial America and beyond, there has been a longstanding itch to see the open-world stealth-action series take on feudal Japan. Consider that itch sufficiently scratched with Ghost of Tsushima. Sucker Punch’s latest is an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history’s most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre has seen. There are some stumbles when it comes to stealth, enemy AI, and a few general minor frustrations, but for just about every moment where Ghost of Tsushima falters, there are plenty more where it soars.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional tale told with fictional characters, but it’s based on the very real invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire in 1274 that began on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of Jin Sakai, capably acted by The Man in the High Castle’s Daisuke Tsuji, who starts off as a samurai before a disastrous battle against the invaders quickly teaches him that perhaps the honorable but restrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima revolves around this inner conflict as Jin’s formative teachings push up against his need to save his homeland at any cost, and though it takes a little while to really get going, it’s a compelling struggle. Even if Jin himself isn’t the most charismatic of protagonists, his foil, Khotun Khan, played by Glee’s Patrick Gallagher, has charisma in spades. He’s one of the most memorable game villains of recent memory thanks to his soft intensity that is oddly calming despite his terrifying intentions. He’s extremely cunning, always one step ahead, and his presence as the “Big Bad” is a large part of why Jin’s 40 to 50-hour quest for vengeance works so well.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        As good as the English voice cast is, though, it’s a shame that Sucker Punch wasn’t able to find a way to have the performance capture match the Japanese voice acting as well. As a result, if you choose to play with the excellent Japanese audio track, which features the outstanding Kazuya Nakai as Jin, it comes off as a comparatively cheap dub with wildly mismatched lip flaps and facial expressions that don’t mirror the emotion in the voice. It’s not a huge issue as it’s still well worth playing in Japanese – and you have the option of enabling the beautiful Kurosawa Mode, which puts a film grainy black-and-white filter over everything to match the style of the classic Akira Kurosawa movies that Ghost of Tsushima so effectively pays homage to. I wouldn’t recommend playing the whole campaign in Kurosawa mode, as there are some quests that demand some color recognition, but it’s a great visual effect to turn on every now and then.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, can we talk about photo mode for a second? Because Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode is the one of the best I’ve ever seen. Partially because the world is just so pretty that it lends itself well to being captured in its natural beauty, but also because of the unique touches that Sucker Punch added, like the ability to have animated background environments or to add a large selection of particles like leaves, fireflies, or even songbirds. You can change the weather, alter the time of day, add clouds, create a camera flight path to create short videos – and all of this on top of all of the essential photo mode options like exposure sliders and filters that have become standard. My one disappointment is the fact that the customizable emotions that you can put on Jin’s face could stand to have a little more… well, emotion. But nonetheless, Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode sets a new high water mark.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time.

                                    Review by Mitchell Saltzman
                                </div>

                                <div class="gameReview">
                                    <p>
                                        New consoles have an illustrious history of launch-day games that are fairly entertaining and technically impressive, but don’t make much of an impact on the generation they help debut. Godfall feels like a game that will probably occupy that space for the PlayStation 5 (to which it is a timed console exclusive), putting it in the company of games like Ryse: Son of Rome on the Xbox One, Red Steel on the Wii, or even (dare I say) Knack on the PlayStation 4. It’s an amusing loot-based hack-and-slasher with a gorgeous look and loads of loadout choice, but a paper-thin story and a lack of variety keep it from being much more than shallow fun.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Despite a feature list that includes three-player online co-op, repeatable missions with randomized loot, and a grindable endgame, developer Counterplay Games says Godfall is not a “game as a service” in the same vein as Destiny – and it doesn’t entirely feel like one, though the influences of that format are clear as day. Instead, the roughly 10 hours it took me to complete its campaign felt like a more linear game wearing the skin of a “live service,” obviously designed for replayability but without the trappings of microtransactions to avoid and an endless update cycle to look forward to.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Part of that skin is an entirely forgettable story that’s the very definition of passable. Godfall’s opening cinematic (which you can watch below) does the bare minimum to loosely establish its beautifully designed world and a warring feud between you – a fallen king named Orin – and the big bad Macros, your brother who is trying to become a god even if it means destroying the world as a result. Your quest to stop him is a threadbare setup to go fight some dudes that's mostly told through info dumps at your base, doing nothing to pull me from one mission to the next but also not so bad as to be distracting. Without spoiling anything, its culmination is about as blunt and pointless as the journey there too.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The missions that make up this story take place on three open-world maps called realms, which are dotted with a decent variety of enemies to kill, chests to open, and resources to gather. A mission will give you a specific goal or target to head toward, but you’re also free to wander around and find other stuff like chests and crafting materials as you do it – or even stick around after the mission to complete extra encounters for even more loot. It’s a structure that surprised me, one that reminded me a lot of Warframe’s sprawling, reward-filled levels but with a set layout instead of a procedurally pieced together one.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        All the while you’re getting more gear with stronger effects and higher numbers to help you scale into the higher numbers of the escalating Dreamstones. But since everything you are fighting has been fought before, no amount of modifiers or loot can keep this endgame interesting for very long. Like I said, there are plenty of playstyle choices and combat mechanics to tinker with, but grinding for all of that stuff is only preparing you for statistically stronger versions of the exact same grind you just did to get it.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Godfall can be an enjoyable and lovely gear-based action game while it lasts, but the repetition of its missions wears thin before the end of its campaign, and even thinner in the endgame afterward. Its combat is packed full of decisions to make and a healthy mix of familiar and genuinely novel mechanics, but its Valorplate suits aren’t as mechanically diverse as they initially seem on their gorgeous exteriors. With neither an interesting story nor a deep pool of varied content, all the choice Godfall offers doesn’t amount to much more than a bit of brief and shallow fun.
                                    </p>

                                        During the gameplay trailer, the game's main menu was revealed to be similar to that of the menu style of Gran Turismo 4. This game brings the return of the GT Simulation Mode, encompassing the long-established and definitive single player campaign feature. Other classic features were shown such as the return of traditional racing tracks and vehicles, Special Events, Championships, Driving School, Tuning Parts Shop, Used Cars dealership, GT Auto while still retaining the new GT Sport Mode, Brand Central and Discover that were introduced in Gran Turismo Sport.

                                        Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an upcoming action-adventure game developed and published by Ember Lab. The story follows Kena, a young spirit guide who uses her magical abilities to help deceased people move from the physical to the spirit world. The game is presented through a third-person perspective. The player uses Kena's staff for attacking enemies, and her pulse ability for defending against attacks. They are tasked with collecting small spirit companions known as the Rot, who help to complete tasks and battle against enemies.

                                       Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Kena, a young spirit guide with magical abilities. In combat, the player uses Kena's staff for light, heavy, and charged attacks. An upgrade transforms the staff into a bow. When defending against enemies, the player can activate Kena's pulse ability, which acts as a shield and has a health meter that depletes when attacked; it also serves to provide clues and activate objects. The player is tasked with collecting small spirit companions known as the Rot. They can be directed to complete tasks, such as moving objects, taking certain shapes, or distracting enemies. The player must damage enemies before the Rot builds enough courage to join battles. The Rot can be customized with different hats. The game utilizes the DualSense controller's haptic feedback for features such as Kena's Spirit Bow.

                                        Sunset Overdrive has ruined my attention span, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. During my 30-hour trip through developer Insomniac's insane but endearing depiction of the apocalypse, I strayed off the beaten path more than I have in any other open-world game in recent memory. Despite the mini-map encouraging me to head 400 meters east, I couldn't help but veer off the route at every opportunity.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        This isn't due to a lack of interesting things to do, but rather a testament to the abundance of them. Because of Sunset's superb traversal, impeccable comedic writing, and wealth of upgrade paths for my character and weapons, I was more than happy to take the road less traveled. More often than not, it led me someplace that I'm thoroughly glad I visited.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Sunset Overdrive visually pops, like the Easter Bunny on an acid trip. Its bright colors, punk-rock attitude, and nose turned up in the direction of authority all meld together wonderfully. Like the cult-classic Jet Set Radio, Sunset assaulted my senses with a never-ending barrage of stimulus. Monsters explode into an ocean of bright-orange viscera, certain weapons allow you fire off a torrent of blazing fireworks, and freezing enemies will result in the word “BRRRR” appearing in the air above them. I really appreciate that Insomniac has crafted a world that successfully adheres to a strong, unique, and artistic vision.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        This distinct style transcends aesthetics, and actually aids in Sunset's most successful and often-used mechanics. Like most any open-world game, the mission structure here has you talking to a character at point A, making your way across the map to point B, and engaging in some activity that usually results in being sent to collect a reward at point C. While that structure might sound monotonous, Sunset makes the very act of traversal a constant joy instead of an obligatory trudge. I rarely found myself using the fast travel system, because this is a game that’s about the journey as much as the destination.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Narrative conceit be damned, your hero or heroine can, using nothing but their own two feet, bounce off anything remotely buoyant, dash through the air, and grind on all manners of power lines, billboards, and anything that presents a right angle. In fact all of this is encouraged thanks to a punitively slow regular ground running speed, the rewards of a smart combo system, and an ridiculous abundance of monsters, soldiers, and robots. Seriously, if you find yourself on the ground for more than 10 seconds, deprived of your godly mobility, chances are you’re going to end up dead shortly after that. But Sunset wisely avoids harsh punishments with quick respawns with amusing animations that lovingly pay homage - in clever ways - to dozens of classic works, from Portal to Terminator to Night of the Living Dead.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        As long as you keep moving and refrain from lingering on the ground, Sunset’s combat proves to be deep, entertaining, and rewarding. I loved fighting enemies like the giant Hurkers, as each encounter felt like a mini-boss fight in and of itself. There’s a great sense of tension in trying to stay moving while maintaining the high ground. And thanks to Sunset’s deep and varied arsenal, I found myself creating some really interesting combos: I’d start off by peppering the area with freeze bombs, which bought me enough time to lay down a field of Acid Sprinklers, and finish it all off with a cascade of exploding teddy bears.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Sunset Overdrive is big, gorgeous, and a hell of a lot of fun. Never has getting from point A to point B in an open-world game provided so much enjoyment. It provides some of the most fun, frantic, and fantastic gaming I've had on the Xbox One. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to once-again adorn my wolf mask, leap off the highest ledge I can find, and fire an explosive stuffed animal at that group of angry robots.

                                <div class="gameReview">
                                    <p>
                                        If you were to judge Ori and the Blind Forest solely by appearances – its prominent images of Ori being cuddled by his rotund adoptive mother Naru, for instance – you might assume you were in for a short, pleasantly tepid art-house platformer, the kind where gameplay exists mainly to support lavish graphics and the emotional pull of the story. Instead, Ori is a demanding, cleverly intricate Metroidvania-style adventure in which a quick trigger finger and perfect timing matter almost as much as exploring its secret-filled environments. That it’s also stunningly pretty, includes a sweeping orchestral score, and tugs at the heartstrings certainly doesn't hurt, either.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Of course, the forest can’t be saved as easily as simply returning your floating companion to his tree. Three stolen, life-sustaining elements need to be restored to their respective homes first, and finding them means trekking across a huge 2D landscape of interconnected areas, uncovering hidden power-ups, and earning new abilities along the way. Like any good Metroidvania, these abilities – which let Ori pull off moves like double-jumping, wall-climbing, stomping through weak platforms, and grabbing enemies or projectiles to slingshot himself in different directions – open up new areas for exploration while adding to Ori's combat repertoire. The progression from powerless sprite-child to nimble engine of destruction is elegantly smooth, with so many opportunities to use each skill that, by the time you've discovered the next one, using the previous ability will have become second nature.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        That's important, because Ori's exploration sometimes feels like training for the real challenges: Its dungeons, a trio of self-contained levels that push you to make heavy use of whatever abilities you've found beforehand, and which sometimes feature unique challenges, like carrying a gravity-bending orb that lets Ori safely walk upside-down across lethally hot surfaces. While taxing, those feel like cakewalks next to each dungeon's climax: an intense, no-room-for-error escape sequence that makes Metroid's time-bomb finales seem tame by comparison. Here, the difficulty spikes wildly as you're forced to execute a precise series of moves while death closes in on your heels. With no checkpoints, mastery through repetition becomes crucial, and that mastery gets a little easier if you can rely on muscle memory to, say, catapult yourself over an incoming fireball before scampering up a wall to relative safety.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The escape sequences walk a fine line between being rewardingly difficult and infuriating, partly because they disable your most important ability: the creation of "Soul Links," which let you save almost anywhere. There's very little auto-saving in Ori, and death reverts you to your last save, so it's up to you to remember to save often. If you do, Soul Links are a huge asset, letting you instantly respawn just before (or after) trouble spots and saving you the hassle of repeating tough areas. Forget to use them, however, and it might take you a while to find your way back to where you were.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Not that that's necessarily a chore; Ori's level design is striking, with lots of distinct, memorable areas that are fun to get around in even after you've visited them a few times. And while there's no fast-travel in Ori's sprawling world (which is mildly annoying), it compensates by making backtracking actually enjoyable. As you work your way back to a previously unreachable spot, your new powers are almost guaranteed to help you discover a few hidden power-ups and secret areas along the way, making the trip feel worthwhile. If you're a completist, however, you'll want to fill out the map before tackling Ori's final stage; completing the 10-hour story locks your save file, forcing you to start a new game (unless you had the foresight to make a pre-endgame copy of your save) if you want to discover things you missed.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Also, Ori always feels fragile, even when his life meter is filled out, and his tiny onscreen presence (coupled with the abundance of glowing projectiles flying both ways) can sometimes make it hard to tell exactly where you are, who's shooting, and whether that shimmering blob sailing toward you is acidic goop or a clutch of harmless XP orbs. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it can lead to a few awkward deaths as you frantically leap into danger to grab a power-up.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Bigger and tougher than it looks, Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautifully realized, brilliantly designed, and at times brutally difficult sylvan Metroidvania-style platformer with enough charm to leave a lasting impression. It's often frustrating and sometimes confusing, but its spectacular platforming, memorable world, and engrossing story wash those concerns away.
                                    </p>

                                        This final, full Verdict and score at the bottom covers the entirety of Crackdown 3, but is not an average of the two. Though the Wrecking Zone multiplayer is bad, it's such a tiny slice of the whole package that its presence doesn't weigh Crackdown 3 down too much.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        "On paper, Crackdown 3’s single-player campaign checks all the boxes that made the original an enjoyable game – but playing through it is about as exciting as running down a checklist and becomes downright repetitive after the first few hours. Its second-to-second combat is uninteresting outside of a couple of boss fights, and even though there’s a compulsive satisfaction to be had in crossing off its many itemized activities, it's never any more than that."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        "While the environmental destruction of Crackdown 3: Wrecking Zone is impressive, it misses every opportunity to use it in interesting ways to enhance the otherwise barebones and uninteresting multiplayer combat, where aiming is all but completely automated. You can see everything Wrecking Zone has to offer in about 30 minutes, minus the time you’re going to spend matchmaking after every round. Unless a lot changes, Wrecking Zone just isn’t worth the time it takes."
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        All these years later, Crackdown 3 delivers on what made the original an enjoyable game, but never much more. Though the compulsive hunt for collectibles can be satisfying for a time, its overall campaign doesn't evolve beyond a mostly bland auto-lock shooting gallery. Its tacked-on Wrecking Zone multiplayer highlights some neat cloud-powered destruction that's never used to great effect in this tiny and woefully barebones mode.

                                        The ultimate pirate fantasy can be different for everyone. Maybe it means you and your crew plundering the vessels of would-be explorers on the open sea as you wreak havoc across the ocean, searching for lost ships and buried treasure on a quest to become a legendary pirate to rival Jack Sparrow, or just singing shanties with a pet monkey. Whatever your particular flavor of piracy, Sea of Thieves’ impressive open-world sandbox gives you the total freedom to do all of that and more while making even its mundane moments fun.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        It’s important to understand that even though Sea of Thieves is a shared-world online adventure game, it’s not actually an MMO with a persistent world. This means that each and every time you log into Sea of Thieves you’re given a brand-new ship in one of three classes based on the size of your crew– Sloop (up to two players), Brigantine (up to three players), or Galleon (up to four players) – and everything except your long-term progression goals are reset. All of the supplies you accumulated last time, the row boat you found, the storage chests you saved – all of it’s gone.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        While the smallest ship can be controlled by a single person, it loses much of what makes the sailing so fun in the process because instead of working together to wrestle the waves you’re running around the deck like a headless pirate scrambling to not crash. Both of the larger vessels really demand bigger group sizes due to their sheer complexity. You and your crew will be running up and down stairs to adjust sails, steer, scope out what lies ahead, fire cannons, and repair damage at the same time – doing all of this by yourself is hard enough on the smallest ship, and nearly impossible on the bigger ones.


                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        If all you care about is hunting other players to engage in PvP combat, there’s actually an entire separate section in the main menu, the Arena, designed just for that. It’s split into two competitive versions: two-player Sloop ships or four-player Galleons. Both modes have the objective of racing to dig up buried treasure using only rough maps as a guide and turning them in at a remote merchant vessel. However, the catch here is that everyone is after the same treasure using the same maps at the exact same time, turning it into a frantic, nautical rat race. The winner is decided based on a point system, where points are awarded for both turning in chests and sinking rival ships. The Arena is exhilarating, stripping away any concerns about deciding where to go next and freeing up my mind to focus solely on PvP.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The team coordination required to be successful in the Arena is nearly an Olympic-level feat and really puts the best and most impressive parts of Sea of Thieves on full display: it encourages cooperation with an all-hands-on-deck-style approach. The sense of realism when raising and lowering sails, firing cannons manually from the side of a ship, and literally digging up buried treasure often leads to memorable moments such as trading canon shots while strafing an island as your crewmate grabs a treasure chest before you narrowly avoid getting rammed by enemy ships by dropping your anchor to spin around with a tight turn, almost like an aquatic drift. Timing and coordination is everything.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Sea of Thieves is a pirate fantasy sandbox with an enormous amount of things to do, made unpredictable and exciting by the addition of other players. Coordinating together across the deck of a massive pirate ship is pure chaos at times, but it’s also endlessly entertaining. The cosmetic-only progression system doesn’t give you as much incentive to keep playing as I’d have liked and its free-form nature left me feeling lost at sea at times – but if you’ve got a good group of two or three friends to play with, it’s hard to find a game as entertaining to jump aboard.

                                        Halo Infinite is an upcoming first-person shooter game developed by 343 Industries and published by Xbox Game Studios for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.The sixth main entry of the Halo series,[10] and the fourteenth Halo game overall, it picks up the story of the Master Chief, following Halo 5: Guardians.

                                        Halo Infinite was planned to release with the Xbox Series X/S on November 10, 2020, but was delayed in August 2020. It is now planned to be released in late 2021.

                                    <p>
                                        According to Microsoft, Master Chief returns in Halo Infinite, the third chapter of the "Reclaimer Saga", with "his greatest adventure yet to save humanity". The storyline of Halo Infinite will be "much more human", with the Master Chief playing a more central role than in Halo 5: Guardians.

                                        The E3 2018 trailer indicated that the story will be set on a Halo ring that has mysteriously suffered damage and also showcased the design of Master Chief's MJOLNIR armor to return to a design similar to that seen in Halo 2 and Halo 3. The Banished, a violent mercenary group that splintered off of the former Covenant alien alliance first seen in Halo Wars 2, appear as the main antagonists of the story.

                                        orza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards.

                                        Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal.
                                    </p>

                                        There’s a glimpse of all four seasons during the four- to five-hour introduction phase, but once the prologue’s first “year” is over seasons will rotate weekly (online or offline). It’s been Autumn throughout the bulk of this review and it might just be my favourite season. There just seems to be so much detail, from the spectrum of colours in the trees as their leaves die off at different rates, to the soggy roadside puddles that persist in an environment that’s becoming too cool for them to evaporate. Winter is excellent, too. If you’ve played Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain, you’ll have a basic idea of what to expect. It’s not just the world turned white; the landscape takes on an entirely new identity.
                                    </p>

                                        It’s gorgeous and I’ve enjoyed exploring it immensely. On Xbox One X I’ve opted to stick with the game’s default “Quality” mode (native 4K, HDR, 30 frames per second) because I’ve been content with playing Horizon games locked at 30 fps in the past, but there is also a “Performance” mode (which cranks up the framerate to 60 and sets the resolution at 1080p, also with HDR). Dawn and dusk in particular are incredible showcases for Horizon 4’s lighting, and it’s these times of day I most enjoy for some more gentle cruising. The overt distinctions between zones aren’t as stark as they are in Horizon 3’s Australia, which shifts from extremes like dry orange desert to dank rainforest, but a massive increase in elevation differences makes up for that. Having Horizon 4’s roads wind over so many hills results in more interesting driving. There’s also a wider difference between road types, which range from wide, modern motorways to narrow alleys and quirky junctions that could’ve been designed hundreds of years before the invention of internal combustion.

                                        The star of the map, however, is Edinburgh, which is much prettier than Horizon 3’s Surfers Paradise. Edinburgh in Horizon 4 is a beautiful place, oozing with history and boasting a really interesting road layout. It’s probably my favourite place to joyride.
                                    </p>

                                        The supporting cast of cars is the biggest it’s ever been in the series, and also the most eclectic, with rides ranging from the 59-kilogram Peel P50 microcar to the ludicrously large Unimog, which is fun but so big it can actually cause the chase camera a spot of grief sometimes when passing under structures. As a car nerd I particularly enjoyed how exceedingly British the barn finds have been, representing a really respectful and well-rounded cross section of British car culture. Mitsubishi seem to have joined Toyota/Lexus in backing out of the Horizon series (for now, at least) but there are 450 cars from more than 100 other manufacturers in Horizon 4, so there are plenty of other options.

                                        I do miss the old Bucket List style a little, though, as I did like running into random cars around the world (and also completing friends’ custom challenges). Horizon Blueprint is back, however, and you can create races in any season or time of day. This is a great way to dabble in seasons that may be several weeks away from occurring in the main game itself. You can also access Blueprint from the pause menu and play custom races on demand. Blueprint doesn’t feature a route creator yet but one is apparently on the way.

                                        Groove Music support is tragically gone following the death of the service, taking Horizon 3’s wonderful in-game OneDrive music support with it. The standalone app still works but it’s not quite the same. That’s the only terrible news in terms of audio, though, because the team have outdone themselves yet again. It’s all tremendous stuff, from the very subtle call of a crow in a quiet winter paddock to the monstrous anti-lag of an Escort Cosworth, which sounds like Satan choking on a popcorn maker.
                                    </p>

                                        I’ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that’s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can’t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn’t just upped the ante once again; it’s blown the bloody doors off.

                                        Gears 5 managed to pleasantly surprise me, both in terms of its gameplay and its story. For a series that’s now six total entries deep, that’s impressive. The Coalition pulled it off by taking the time to develop its trio of young heroes beyond the foundations established in Gears of War 4 and having the guts to alter the course of the series in a way I didn’t expect. And while it makes no attempt to fix what isn’t broken with the rock-solid cover-based shooting gameplay, it does augment it in interesting ways and experiments with an open-world structure.rewards.

                                        Combine all of that with a broad set of multiplayer modes that range from the trusty old stalwarts to bold and spicy new takes on both co-op and competitive gameplay, and what’s presented is a tremendous package that stands as one of the year’s best action games.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Gears’s third-person action has evolved slowly but steadily from one entry to the next, and in Gears 5 the bulk of what’s new flows through Jack, your handy floating robot companion. He can now snag weapons from the battlefield for you and unlock safes, among other actions, and you’ll earn new abilities for him to use in combat, such as flash-blinding your foes, reviving you and your allies when you’re down, cloaking you, and more. Upgrade components are littered across the world, so you can decide to hyper-specialize in a few areas or have a little bit of every ability. I appreciated the extra tactical layers he offered, and while I did vary my selected Jack ability depending on the situation, I was particularly thankful for the healing power of Stim in the latter part of the campaign, which saved me from dying more than once.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        [And] boy oh boy does Gears’ combat still feel good. This may be the only series where I’m always happy to have the default weapon – the trusty Lancer – in my loadout at all times, just in case I get a chance to chainsaw a bad guy in half. The Overkill shotgun returns from Gears of War 4 and packs a potent punch, while classics like the Longshot, Boomshot, and Mulcher are still around to satisfyingly chew your foes into little fleshy chunks. New weapons like the Claw manage to feel unique but fit right in, too; Gears 5 does a tremendous job of balancing the old toys with new ones.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Also new is Gears 5’s open structure of its middle two acts. You’ll roam the area on your wind-powered Skiff, free to tackle optional secondary objectives that vary in duration and challenge. Usually your reward is Jack upgrades, so they’re very worth doing. This is a nice change of pace for Gears, just like it was for God of War last year -- who’s to say whether that was by intention or coincidence, but the fact that the first of these sections is set in a frozen tundra only makes it harder to ignore the similarity). Multiple varied boss fights also help Gears 5 feel fresh throughout.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Arcade is the standout of Gears 5’s iteration of Versus. This new mode is a more casual and chaotic game type that welcomes those who feel they’re always the Gnashed, never the Gnasher, with open arms. Instead of starting everybody with the standard Lancer/Gnasher loadout, you’re given an arsenal based on your character, which can be changed at any point between deaths during the match. Don’t expect to see premium weapons littered on the map with a timer attached to them, either; instead, you buy special weapons and equipment like a Markza MK1 (my weapon of choice) or incendiary grenades with skulls earned by downing and killing enemies. You’re even rewarded with a skull if you die a lot, which can help prevent the feeling of being stuck in a dead-end loop. Your skulls persist through deaths too, giving people who don’t necessarily excel at getting consecutive kills a chance to get a fun piece of equipment. There's also a lobby for co-op versus against bots, so if you’re bringing a new friend into Gears there’s a place for them to learn how to ease into competitive play instead of just tossing them into the meat grinder.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The most exciting of the [Horde] characters, though, is Jack. Your robot buddy from the campaign is a key support character in multiplayer too and is a ton of fun when facing off with your team against wave after wave of fodder. Instead of equipping weapons, Jack has a built-in laser he can use to stun and damage enemies and a repair tool that can heal allies and rebuild fortifications. Better yet, his ultimate ability allows him to assume control of an enemy unit for a limited amount of time – which is enough to do cool stuff like take control of a Bastion and have it self-destruct in the middle of a bunch of Swarm. At first glance he seems like the character you’d assign to a less experienced player, which is not a bad idea because he can hang back and lend a hand without taking as much direct fire. But in the hands of an experienced player, he can be used to pull off some really awesome strategies, especially since he automatically goes invisible after being left alone for some time. I’d use his increased mobility to flank tough enemies and to collect important weapons for my teammates.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        To be clear, it’s not surprising at all that Gears 5 is an excellent third-person action game. This iconic series has never really had a misfire, even when changing hands from original developer Epic to The Coalition, and the hot streak remains unbroken. What was unexpected is just how effectively it doubles down on story with a character-focused, consequence-filled tale that plays to one of the franchise’s most underappreciated strengths and backs it up with fun, welcome additions to both its gameplay formula and flow. And that’s just the campaign: add in a heavy-hitting multiplayer lineup of Versus, Versus Arcade, Horde, and Escape and it makes Gears 5 one of the best and most versatile action-game packages in recent memory.

                                        The main characters of Quantum Break may frequently find themselves stuck in time, yet developer Remedy Entertainment appears to have no such problem. The team behind Max Payne and Alan Wake has successfully managed to evolve its signature style of cinematic shoot-’em-up for its latest release; seamlessly melding digital gunplay and TV-inspired storytelling without compromising the quality of either side of the experience. While I wish the combat stakes had been raised a little higher in its second half, Quantum Break remains a stylish and often-exhilarating third-person shooter wrapped up in a tautly paced tale of time travel.

                                        Consisting of five gameplay acts interspersed with four breakneck-paced episodes of a live-action TV-style show, Quantum Break opens - as so many great sci-fi stories do - with a catastrophic accident in a research lab, one that creates a potentially world-ending fracture in time and imbues (or perhaps, infects) both the hero and his chief antagonist with time-bending powers.

                                        In the hands of hero Jack Joyce, this satisfying suite of superpowers work in tandem with more traditional cover-based shooter mechanics to take the bullet time of Remedy’s original Max Payne games to... Well, the max. Joyce can blink-teleport from one side of the room to the other, slowing down time long enough to blindside an enemy with a shotgun blast. He can momentarily suspend an enemy in a time bubble, unload a full submachine gun clip into it, and allow the bubble to burst so that two dozen headshots all arrive at once. He can create an impenetrable time shield, sprint past sniper fire like the Flash, and even charge up and hurl ‘time bombs’ to scatter groups of enemies like shrieking dandelion spores. The downside to such a range is that half a dozen different cooldown timers on screen are easily mixed up during the heat of a battle.

                                        While it’s still grounded amidst the typical shooter tropes - every warehouse area seems to have taken a fresh delivery from Acme Explosive Barrel Company, for example - Quantum Break does facilitate some truly unique playgrounds for its time-stopping action to unfold in. Frequent stutters in time create eye-popping dioramas out of the destruction around you. Dispatched enemies cartwheel back from bullet impacts and freeze in midair, the bloodspray from their exit wounds crystallizing in the air like icicles of claret. Out-of-control cars become trapped in an infinite instant replay as they crash, rewind, and crash again. Innocent bystanders are caught in a state of suspended animation, their morning coffee spilling into a frozen arc in front of their stunned faces. It’s a unique and wonderfully eerie environment to inhabit - like wandering around inside a 3D screenshot - and certainly a stylish space in which to live out your every violent, Wachowski-inspired whim.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        And what of the four live-action segments themselves? Well, any concerns about them coming across like hokey FMV cutscenes from the 32-bit era are quickly quashed; Quantum Break features a level of production and performances to rival the best original programming currently found on the big-name streaming services (not to mention some familiar faces from the likes of Game of Thrones and The Wire). Sitting and watching for 20-30 minutes at a time sounds like a long time to put your controller down (unless you’re a Metal Gear diehard), but it wasn’t nearly as disruptive as I’d feared. With their abundance of dramatic confrontations, high-speed car chases, and shaky-cam scraps, the hurried pacing of these segments kept me happily watching while my trigger fingers were temporarily on ice.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Most importantly, these segments successfully serve to humanise the villains, and not merely because they’re played by real-life actors. There’s the conflicted super soldier with the pregnant wife at home, the IT surveillance geek keen to climb the corporate ladder, and the company CEO locked in an internal struggle for power with Serene. Once an episode ends you return to pulverising wave after wave of faceless Monarch soldiers, so it’s not like this switch in perspective makes you think twice about Joyce’s actions (and certainly you’re never given any opportunity to not kill everybody you encounter) - but at the very least it gives a refreshing degree of context rarely afforded to the evildoers within the shooter genre.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The only downside to Quantum Break’s live-action portion is the fact that the episodes are streamed online - meaning you’re at the mercy of your home internet connection as far as the quality of the playback is concerned. Disruptive content buffering was a fairly regular occurrence during my two playthroughs, as were graphical issues during the gameplay sections such as screen tearing and noticeable texture pop-in. I can only assume that these are all forms of glitches and time stutters that the developer didn’t intend.
                                    </p>

                                        Quantum Break is an artistically distinct shooter, with a compelling and malleable plot and excellent performances from its main players in both their digital and live-action forms. While I wish more thought had gone into maintaining the thrill of discovering its time-twisting powers from start to finish, it ultimately didn’t prevent me from thoroughly enjoying Quantum Break’s 10-hour campaign, two times over.

                                        State of Decay 2’s open-world battle for survival against a zombie menace is the right kind of post-apocalyptic fun. It creates plenty of high-stakes moments, punctuated by the relative calm of foraging for supplies while always looking over your shoulder. It’s a potent mixture for a while, until the combination of repetitive missions and annoying bugs eventually dulls the joy of squashing heads, even when your co-op entourage rolls deep.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Just like in 2013’s original State of Decay, in State of Decay 2 you can freely switch between randomly generated survivors in your post-apocalyptic community – and you’ll regularly have to, because they can only be pushed so far before their stamina starts to give out. Or worse, you did something stupid and got someone permanently killed, taking their unique traits and whatever leveled-up skills they’ve acquired with them. You’re not able to customize their names or looks at all, which is a shame, because if XCOM has taught us anything it’s that it’s fun to tell your friends and co-workers how you got them killed. But that fear of loss (you can’t reload from an earlier save!) adds some significant weight to the struggle that plays out on one of three open-world rural maps, as you scavenge the region to build a shelter and work to cleanse the land of a disease known as the Blood Plague.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Unlike the original, though, State of Decay 2 can be played in its entirety (after the tutorial) in four-player co-op, which even works cross-platform between PC and Xbox One. The joining parties enter the host’s game and get to bring back all their looted spoils (aside from resources) plus bonus rewards to their own game. It’s a near-universal truth that games like this become more fun when played with friends, and that holds very true in State of Decay 2.
                                    </p>

                                        There’s not much more to the generic post-zombie-apocalypse story than the quest to wipe out the Blood Plague – at least not that I’ve encountered in a single playthrough on one of the three maps, the Plateau – but there’s some background radio chatter that suggests a bigger world of survivors and organizations out there that could someday make an appearance. Everything else is told on a smaller, more personal scale: individual characters will have their own quest lines assigned to them, such as one woman who wanted to track down what happened to a police officer friend of hers in a series of missions, and when you eventually appoint a leader to your group, their randomly determined class appears to influence how your story ends. (Mine was a Warlord, as opposed to Sheriff, Trader, and Builder, which as you can imagine ended with lots of shooting.) But generally it’s a sandbox-style RPG where you’re tackling dynamically appearing quests as people call for help, and you make your own story in the way you deal with them.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        While zombies are so omnipresent in the open world that you can hardly swing a dead cat without hitting one, they’re spread thin: next to something like Dead Rising 4 or what we’ve seen in those Days Gone trailers, the number of “zeds” you encounter in the open world at any one time is positively quaint. It’s rare to see more than a dozen at once, and the so-called “hordes” that appear on the map are limited to five or six. It’s enough to keep you on your toes, but individual zombies are more a nuisance than a threat.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Fortunately, the moment-to-moment combat against the rank-and-file undead is simple but satisfying. Melee never really evolves beyond button-mashing while keeping an eye on your stamina meter, but you can unlock some specializations that allow you to quickly throw an enemy to the ground and leave it vulnerable to a delightfully gruesome head-popping execution move. And, when you score a critical hit and knock its block off with a single swing of a bat or swipe of a machete (instead of bludgeoning them four or five times first) it’s a tiny moment of power.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        State of Decay 2’s zombie-infested maps are good places to scavenge, fight, and survive in. Combat is satisfyingly brutal and the special zombies inspire some real fear of permanent death, even though the Blood Plague turns out to be more of a sniffle. But the bugs are just as persistent as the zombies, and after a dozen or so hours the repetition of both eventually take their toll, making the appeal of replaying feel more limited than I’d expected for a sandbox RPG.

                                       In Zoo Tycoon, nothing is more important than your animals. Whether you're simply watching an elegant giraffe leaning over a pool to drink water or marveling at the adorable baby elephants romping around, every species in this menagerie is delightful. But unlike the original Zoo Tycoon games for PC, the Xbox One version’s poorly laid out menus and worse Kinect functionality make them hard to enjoy.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        You learn how to become a zookeeper through 10 in-depth training missions that clearly explain the most important aspects of the job – building exhibits and managing the layout – while not overwhelming you with details. This is where you learn to swap between the neat third-person exploration mode and the top-down Tycoon mode. It’s also the first time you get a taste of the inefficient menus you must consistently flip through to conduct zoo business, no matter which of the three modes you’re playing.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        While menus are a consistent and important part of every sim, especially the older Zoo Tycoon games on PC, they’re poorly designed for the Xbox One. There are nice page-turning sound effects and some extra educational information, but that's where the praise ends.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        I expected Campaign Mode to roar louder than the other two, but its 20 levels all feel too similar to one another – and to the tutorial – and boredom sets in quickly. Their rewards are just as thin, with only a couple of decorations and a location to unlock for use in the other two modes. Challenge Mode tests your ability to make the most of your resources by plopping you in a location with a set budget, along with periodic objectives. But if you’ve ever balanced a checkbook, the difficulty here doesn’t live up to the mode’s name. Freeform Mode is the only place where Zoo Tycoon spreads its wings and refreshingly lets go of the confines of money and research. The only goals are to enjoy yourself, the animals, and build whatever you want at your own pace and progression comes at a rewarding pace.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Multiplayer allows you and up to three friends to work together in any of the three modes, but unless you’re using headsets it can be hard to coordinate. Everyone can contribute to tasks for completion, so getting objectives done is easier than ever. It’s also fun to ride around with friends in buggies in third-person view. But you can still only research one thing at a time which seems limiting when you have extra people waiting around for certain things to finish researching.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Again, though, it all comes back to the animals, and in theory, Kinect offers a whole new way to interact with them. They’re a disappointment. You can build three Kinect-capable interactions in your zoo, but they only work for specific animals. Feeding and washing animals with Kinect can be frustrating because the camera didn’t always pick up my movements, but the facial recognition is incredible when it works. While it can only be used with chimps and big cats, they can distinguish when you’re blinking or opening your mouth and mirror your actions. I loved playing with my baby chimps… but it’s always faster and easier to use the controller to manipulate the animals than Kinect.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Zoo Tycoon aims to be educational and entertaining for kids of all ages, and in some instances it succeeds. While the animals are gorgeously detailed in their own right, learning about them and creating an enriching environment for the cuddly critters isn’t always presented in an enjoyable way. Additionally, the never-ending menus are extremely cumbersome, and young players may get lost while trying to navigate through them for every single thing. Its charming and adorable animals can melt hearts, but most of your time will be spent navigating through bad menus.

                                       Like a home away from home, Ashen feels both startlingly familiar and original. A44’s action-RPG wears its Dark Souls-inspired identity proudly, delivering nearly identical mechanics and progression systems along with a captivating open world and gorgeous art style. Those, combined with charmingly minimalistic two-player co-op, elevate Ashen to more than just a Dark Souls clone. Whether you’re tiptoeing through a shadowy dungeon, squaring off against a massive boss, or exploring off the main pathway, Ashen has enough of its own ideas to feel additive instead of derivative.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ashen tells a standard but well-written story of a battle between light and darkness, elevated by solid voice acting. The eponymous god – a large, radiant bird – disappeared years ago, sending the world that it had kept whole into a bleak period of darkness. The heart of the story comes from the environments you explore, the people you meet, and their mixture of hope and despair as they await the return of the Ashen. As you begin to restore a normal semblance of life to this world, the beauty of what was once lost in darkness becomes even clearer. Though understated in its delivery, it’s a stirring and atmospheric tale.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Like so many games of this growing subgenre, its gameplay shamelessly borrows the major trappings of Dark Souls’ established and beloved combat. Not only is it weighty and methodical, but it uses the same controls for light and heavy attacks, and those, along with dodge rolls that keep your proverbial fat out of the literal fire, consume stamina from your meter. It relies on close-range combat with single-handed and two-handed weapons. Each decisive maneuver can be the difference between life and death – unless, of course, you drink from your Crimson Gourd, which is Ashen’s version of Estus Flask, to restore your health. And, naturally, when you die you lose all of your Scoria, Ashen’s take on Souls. Yes, if you return to the spot of your death before dying again you can retrieve your precious currency. Recall the relief of seeing a bonfire after a series of challenging fights in Dark Souls? Ashen has ritual stones, which are used for saving and fast-travel.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Nowhere is careful play required more than in the few dungeons that lead to boss fights. Darkened hallways with lurking enemies at every turn and haunted ice skeletons waiting to come to life force you to move slowly and pay close attention to your surroundings. More times than I’d care to admit, I made my way deep into a dungeon only to get reckless and unceremoniously perish, leaving a substantial pile of Scoria in a spot where retrieving it wasn’t a given. Enemies hound you, compiling devastating blows into swift combos. They dodge your inattentive slashes of the club and laborious swings of the ax with ease. Surviving until you recover your Scoria or see the glow of a ritual stone requires laser focus and a smart, well-executed strategy.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Although Ashen only contains five true boss fights across its 20 hours, each one is an epic and daunting task that emphasizes uncovering weaknesses. My personal favorite is Amiren, a colossal woman wielding a large staff and lantern who can render your attacks basically worthless and her deploy magic attacks over a huge portion of the room. At first, this fight seemed impossible – I thought it would take an hour or more to chip away at her health. I died multiple times before I realized her weakness and exploited it, leading to a highly satisfying victory.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ashen also includes a couple features that let you up the difficulty, if you’re feeling cocky. You can equip a talisman that removes the need to play alongside a human or AI companion, for instance. Midway through the adventure, I unlocked Children of Sissna, a main menu option that allows you to start over from the beginning with less health and stamina, significantly raising the stakes. The Challenge difficulty level is currently wrecking me, but I want to build up Vagrant’s Rest once again – even if it takes me more than 20 hours this time.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Ashen takes liberally from Dark Souls when it comes to combat and progression, but it’s a very good take on the formula that delivers satisfying, strategic combat and progression that rewards careful play. Thanks to a gorgeous, varied open world and neat, passive cooperative features, Ashen comes into its own wonderfully.

The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of this scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.

                                            The untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            It all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I’ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain. It’s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Hundreds of NPCs waiting to send you on side quests and puzzle shrines pepper the landscape, and there’s even more to discover hidden behind vague clues. The fetch-questy ones aren’t as interesting as the bonafide rabbit holes of The Witcher 3, but they still introduce you to interesting characters and dole out helpful info, meals, and materials. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues: in one example, a wandering minstrel sang a mysterious song that dropped hints as to the location of a special shrine. Some don’t even show up as quests in your log, so you have to pay attention.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Puzzle shrines yield their own useful rewards in the form of materials and handy weapon upgrades. These shrines involve short, inventive puzzle rooms which present you with a few clues and leave your to experiment in order to solve them. There’s a wide variety of them and a majority are excellent little puzzles to figure out, but a few of the combat-focused challenges are repeated and another handful use motion controls that just don’t feel quite as sharp enough due to wonky physics.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Still, the techniques you learn from Shrines become essential training for Breath of the Wild’s fantastic dungeons. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won’t go into too much detail, but these daunting, massive logic puzzles demand that you look at all the moving pieces in order to solve them. But every time I came across a new Shrine I was excited to uncover whatever new challenge it contained, with some Shrines in particular feeling as intricate as early levels in Portal, because they hinted at something much bigger and more impressive to come.

                                            There are even more cryptic challenges throughout Hyrule, some hidden behind riddles, and others are large mazes or other inventive ideas. Even after 50 hours, I still can’t believe I haven’t seen almost everything, but the surprises keep on coming. I estimate it would take over 100 hours to solve every side quest, puzzle, and collectible. It is a truly massive game to tackle.
                                        </p>

                                            The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.

                                            There are so many different types of Animal Crossing players, and yet Animal Crossing: New Horizons manages to improve upon the virtual lives of each player type that I can think of. For The Collector, there's a near-bottomless bounty of bugs, fish, and furniture to gather; for The Designer, there are new tools and few limits to what you can craft and customize. But it’s the The Artists, The Decorators, and The Dreamers who should be most excited: There's an entire island to jazz up, expanding the customizable area far beyond the walls of your house, which is all that previous Animal Crossing games allowed them to tinker with. Throw a swimming pool on the beach; add a giant kaiju statue to your garden; even literally move mountains. You can customize so much in New Horizons that it has me just as excited to see what people create as recent, lauded craft-'em-ups like Super Mario Maker 2 or Dreams.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            In order to deliver a blank slate for you to customize the crap out of, Nintendo made some questionable calls that lead to a very slow start to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yes, Animal Crossing always starts out slow. But New Horizons is even slower: At the outset, two brave villagers and a very industrious raccoon family are the island's only residents. Cut off from any mainland, it's just you, trees, water, rocks, and slow accumulation of buildings and animal villagers over the course of several (real time) days. It's a different vibe than moving to a new town already full of bustling shops and animals going about their lives, and while building a town from scratch offers a lot of customization, it takes too long to get to the good stuff. And by “good stuff” I mean the basics: The museum, shopping, and even access to parts of the island which require tools like the pole and ladder to reach, all days away from when you first load up New Horizons on your Switch.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Like past games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons uses your Nintendo system’s real clock, which means many game goals are locked behind a "sleep wall." Like the paywall found in some mobile games, which requires you to pay real money for resources to progress, in New Horizons you have to wait until the next actual day to see the bridge you built, or the store you upgraded, or the animal you invited to town come to fruition. There's just not enough to do for these first few days while the sleepy island is waking up. You can't scale cliffs or cross rivers until you satisfy requirements that span several real time days. To make it worse, resources deplete and reset daily, so outside of fishing and bug hunting you can't even effectively farm for bells while you wait. Unless, of course, you cheat it by changing that system clock. See below for my thoughts on that...
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            You can take a day trip to a randomly generated "nearby" island, which might have different fruit to nab, but "nearby" means the islands you visit are in the same season, so you won't be finding rare winter fish while its summer on your island. This is disappointing, because I loved the ability to go to an offshore island in 3DS's New Leaf. It allowed you to cheat the seasons and nab summer beetles (worth a bundle of Bells!) year round. The nearby islands of New Horizons are a dull substitute.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Animal Crossing: New Horizons has several different multiplayer modes, including local play on a single switch, where your friends can join with a single Joy Con. It's cool, but chaotic, and aside from showing off your island and taking group photos, there's not much to do but get in the way of each other. You can also visit other islands over a local connection (you have to be really close: About five feet away. If you lose the connection, you lose all the stuff you picked up on another island.) One of my favorite things about 3DS's New Leaf was its StreetPass mode which allowed you to passively view strangers' houses and order furniture you saw there. There's no convenient way to see random islands or order cool stuff from others like that in New Horizons, and that disappointingly cripples discovery. We'll just have to share our amazing homes, fashion choices, and island designs elsewhere.

                                            Although I didn't encounter any major holidays during my review period with Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo has announced that those are coming as free DLC updates (which means you cannot time travel to see them early; they don't exist yet). But I did take part in some amusing special events, including a meteor shower where I collected star fragments; a selfie-taking, influencer otter who gave me a fishing challenge; and a chameleon who paid top dollar for bugs. Along with classic visitors like Sahara, Gulliver and Wisp, there's always something going on in town.

                                            The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Super Mario each found new life on the Nintendo Switch, and following those games in kind is Animal Crossing: New Horizons: An expanded, polished, next-generation reboot of a classic Nintendo game. Perhaps most importantly, like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is full of surprises. I cannot wait to see what's to come: Seeing cool custom islands from the community, special events, season changes. It took too long to get to the most exciting part of my island renovation (until I cheated), but now that all of New Horizons is spread before me, I have plenty to do, big plans for my island, and so much to look forward to.

                                            Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Nintendo Switch is a souped-up version of the Wii U’s Mario Kart 8. When I reviewed Mario Kart 8 almost three years ago, I thought it was an amazing game and awarded it a score of a 9.0. Here’s what I said then:

                                            “Mario Kart 8 is the best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but you’re getting a lot more than just looks with this one – although I spent an awful lot of time gawking at the details in slow-motion, the fast and furious pace of racing with friends both locally and online is what really kept me coming back.”

                                            Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes all of that, plus all the previously released DLC along with some new additions. That means you’re getting 48 great courses and 42 diverse characters, including new ones like Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from Splatoon, and some neat extras like the unbelievably fast 200cc speed class. Every course, character, and mode is unlocked right from the start, meaning you can just jump right in and hit the track.

                                            If you already have the Wii U version, the real reason to pick up Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the revamped Battle mode. Nintendo added five smart objective-based modes, and each one brings its own unique competitive angle to its eight varied arenas. In Balloon Battle, you have to take advantage of items and smart positioning to score points by popping your rivals’ balloons. Shine Thief is a wacky, action-packed riff on keep away. Bob-bomb Blast is an explosive, over-the-top face-off. I wish I were more motivated to play Coin Runners, though. Gathering or swiping coins from others is okay, but not nearly as exciting by comparison.

                                        <p>
                                            The biggest highlight is the suspenseful fight-or-flight nature of Renegade Roundup. It’s a round-based mode where a team of outlaws desperately tries to avoid a squad of Piranha Plant cops until the timer runs out. If a teammate is captured, you can free them with some skillful driving, but it comes at the risk of getting caught and losing the match if you’re the last man standing. That sets up tense make-or-break moments that can be genuinely thrilling with the right team. You can play any of these modes against bots of varying intelligence, but the real fun is online.

                                            That said, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s online suite is still as barebones an experience on the Switch as it was on the Wii U. Some of its improvements are notable – for example, it’s faster to get you into a game, and you can finally swap characters or karts between races. But the Switch still feels like a hassle next to the convenience of other systems because you still have to use outside means (like your phone) to communicate with friends. It’s aggravating that there’s no way to invite players to join your matches, too. Considering this is the first major online multiplayer game for Switch, it’s disappointing to see that so little was done to smooth out that experience.

                                            Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an amazing game for all the same reasons I mentioned in our original review. It’s still a gorgeous kart racer and every bit as addictive as it was in 2014. This is the best entry in the series so far, and it has all the content you’ll need. Returning players have seen a lot of this game before, but the overhauled Battle mode and its five additional ways to play are a great reason to pick it up. Nintendo didn’t do enough to make the online experience better, but the rest of this game holds up well.

                                            It feels as if the paint had just begun to dry on Splatoon after its release on the Wii U in 2015 when Nintendo applied a fresh coat and relaunched it with Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That may be why this sequel feels less like a whole new game than a new version of the first one that rolls up the best post-launch updates to the colorful and adorably non-violent team-based shooter and adds some new toys. Of course, considering the first game is a lot of fun, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you missed it for lack of a Wii U. And despite some questionable choices that can leave you trapped in matchmaking purgatory, the addition of a standout and clever take on a co-op horde mode provides some seriously addicting fun that has me coming back for more.

                                           Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2‘s emphasis on using vibrant, ink-based weapons to splatter both enemies and the ground alike in your team color to control territory makes it a distinctive kind of visually rewarding fun. Controlling the ground is more than just a way of keeping score, though – you’re far more mobile in your own territory, creating lots of opportunity for strategies around creating a highway to an objective and cutting off your opponents, and also setting up areas to submerge into the ink and replenish your ammo. The key to victory on the eight distinct and symmetrical maps currently in rotation often lies in being aware of terrain, ink management, and the opposition’s plans.

                                            Between the original arsenal, the guns added in post-launch updates, and the new ones introduced in Splatoon 2, there’s plenty of ink-based weaponry to choose from, and yet each type has distinct uses. There’s the fast and furious Inkbrush that covers ground quickly, contrasted with the Slosher that manages to turn a literal bucket of ink into a deadly close-range weapon. One of my favorites of the new batch is the Dualies, dual-pistol style weapons that have a great rate of fire and also let you quickly dodge-roll when firing to strafe enemies and release a concentrated burst of ink. There’s also a brand-new array of special weapon powerups, many of which work well with proper coordination to break stalemates. The protective Ink Armor shields your entire team from harm, while the Tenta Missiles can lock onto and fire a salvo of ink strikes on multiple enemies.

                                            Playing locally with friends is a blast – my teammates and I frantically screamed out boss names and locations of golden eggs to direct each other to counter problems and capitalize on opportunities. But this also highlights how key communication is to survival, something that doesn’t currently translate well in random online matchups, where you can only give basic callouts. Fortunately, with Nintendo’s new companion app you can create voice chat groups with friends on your phone - but there are some significant problems. While you can check out nifty details about matches and order more gear from your app, the voice chat system feels woefully lacking. You can only chat with friends in certain modes, and while chatting your phone cannot be used for anything else (even turning off the screen will mute all conversation). Given that the app won’t let you talk to friends outside of specific lobbies, and that I’m not a fan of having my phone battery drained by a screen that can’t be turned off, I’m much more inclined to use Skype or Discord to talk with friends.

                                            And speaking of bizarre catches: for some reason, the excellent co-op mode can only be played online on certain days for specific amounts of time – for instance, 5:00AM to 5:00PM – which is truly frustrating considering just how fun it is. After a fun weekend playing with friends, finding out I can’t play again for two days can get annoying, especially when I can’t discern any rhyme or reason to the Salmon Run schedule. Not being able to easily remember the next available slot time forces me to constantly check in-game for the next five openings. I get that Nintendo wants to ensure full rooms on the days Salmon Run is active, but this seems like a poor way to do it. I’d rather have the option to queue up with friends online or have a way to easily back out if nobody is around to play with (going it alone is pretty much a death sentence). On the days the mode is active, you can earn quick rewards not found anywhere else which is a nice bonus; if you choose to play locally you can play as much as you want, but it takes much longer to earn bonuses.

                                            By this point you would have noticed that a significant portion of Splatoon 2 is played online, which can present it's own set of unique issues for local gamers, our internet situation being what it is. We managed to get pretty good results using both a 4mb ADSL line and 20mb LTE line. In either case, gameplay was smooth and there was very little in the way of dropped connections and lag was manageable.

                                            The primary issue with getting online had less to do with the quality of internet infrastructure and more to do with finding people to play with. We anticipate this will become much less of an issue when the game actually launches and the online population for the game increases. For the first few days, though, don't be surprised if you can't find other squids to splat with.

                                            There’s a lot to love in Nintendo’s second iteration of its quirky shooter, especially the way Splatoon 2 emphasizes splatting the ground just as much as it does inking your opponents. The new additions to its single-player campaign and multiplayer modes are a step in the right direction, but it still has some work to do to make joining online games and voice chat less of a hassle. Still, with an addicting new Salmon Run co-op mode and the promise of free updates like the ones that helped the original Splatoon come into its own, I expect Splatoon 2 to keep me hooked.

                                            s series director Masahiro Sakurai said himself, it’s a miracle Super Smash Bros. Ultimate exists. Having Mario and Zelda duke it out against Street Fighter’s Ryu and Final Fantasy 7’s Cloud on a battlefield from Metal Gear Solid is a weird, wonderful thing that only the Smash Bros. series can deliver – and Ultimate is undoubtedly Smash Bros. done big and done right.

                                            With 74 fighters (depending on how you count), 108 stages, nearly 1300 Spirit characters to collect, and a single-player Adventure mode that took me a full 24 hours of playtime to beat, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate offers far more in a single package than any of its four predecessors. And while it occasionally felt like pruning away some of its weaker bits could have made Ultimate an even stronger and more consistent whole, excellent new mechanical and aesthetic additions make it stand out as far more than just a rehash of old ideas. It’s nothing short of the brand-new Smash Bros. game I’d imagined as the ideal sequel for the Switch.

                                           Smash Bros. has always been a fighting series that successfully pleases two crowds that are usually at odds: those who are seeking the pure, chaotic joy of an eight-player button-mashing brawl and those who prefer tense matches of hard-fought, high-level skill. While more competitive-minded players may turn off items and only fight on the completely flat Final Destination stage (or the functionally identical “Omega” versions of any of its other stages), others may find that unexpected items, deadly stage hazards, and epic Final Smash finishing moves are just as much at the core of what makes Smash Bros. great. Both – and every setting in between – coexist beautifully in Ultimate.

                                            More so than any previous game in the 19-year Smash Bros history, Ultimate is all about gathering as many iconic characters as possible from all over gaming – stretching far past its Nintendo-only origins – and letting you pit them against each other however you’d like. It’s a digital action figure toy box overflowing with the childhood memories of countless gamers, but with the beating heart of a competitive fighting game.

                                            It’s also remarkably easy to jump in, choose your favorite character and just start fighting, since it doesn’t take much more than the control stick and two buttons to have access to most of a fighter’s moveset. Unlike the Street Fighters, Mortal Kombats, and Tekkens of the world, here there aren’t complicated input-combos beyond pressing A or B along with a single direction, making it simple to learn what a character can do just by playing around instead of having to look up move lists and spend time in a practice mode.

                                            Either docked of handheld, the only real issues I noticed were related to load times, but mostly in places where it didn’t matter much. For example, waiting for Mii fighter outfits to load in the creator makes building a character annoyingly slow, and a fighter’s alternate colors can sometimes take a few seconds to appear on the character-select screen, but matches, menus, and everything else important loads fairly fast. There was also some very slight frame lag during character select with eight players, but that seems forgivable considering it disappeared during the match itself.

                                            On the hardware side, playing with the Switch’s Joy Con controllers works okay, but they don’t really allow for the best Smash experience. I am a huge fan of the Joy Con generally, but the flatter joysticks and digital triggers aren’t ideal for the fast and precise movements Smash Bros. demands. I spent most of my time playing Ultimate with my childhood GameCube wireless WaveBird controller with a USB adapter, but the Switch Pro Controller works extremely well, too. It’s nice that there’s a variety of control options, and you can even use a single sideways Joy Con in a pinch (though I don’t really recommend it), but getting a peripheral controller feels more necessary here than with other Switch games.

                                            Ultimate also has some pretty interesting online features, including a system that essentially lets you collect the virtual dog tags of anyone you beat online. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test this out because the online features weren’t available ahead of launch. We’ll have to monitor those post-launch and see if there are any issues, but if Splatoon 2 and Mario Tennis Aces are any indication, Nintendo seems to have a significantly better handle on online play than when Super Smash Bros. launched on the Wii U.

                                            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate lives up to its name, offering the most comprehensive game in the series to date. It has an absurd amount to play, fight, and unlock – though that can be to its detriment at times. While the World of Light adventure mode isn’t reason alone to get Smash Bros., it’s still a consistently amusing and shockingly large campaign, and a worthy compliment to Ultimate’s incredible multiplayer core. The Smash Bros. series has always maintained a wonderful balance of chaotic beat-em-up fun and tense fighting game action, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate refines and improves on both sides of itself without abandoning either one.

                                    </div>

                                        <p>
                                            One of the first things that struck me when I started playing Half-Life: Alyx was the dirt under Alyx Vance’s fingernails. It’s a simple thing, but it’s not often that you see that level of fine detail in a VR game. Usually, virtual hands are either low-detail ghostly apparitions or gloved. This grit also tells us something about this character, a scrappy survivor raised in the aftermath of the Seven-Hour War in which the alien Combine conquered Earth, and it quickly establishes that she isn’t as buttoned-down as that MIT-educated nerd Dr. Gordon Freeman. Subtle as it is, it sets the stage for the best VR shooter I’ve ever played by a mile – and one of the best in any perspective.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The next thing that stood out, jarring me out of gazing at my hands like a first-time stoner, was probably the gigantic, 30-foot Strider leg that smashed down directly in front of me as it moved past, going about its business. That established, with great force, the immense scale of the mosquito-like alien tanks we first fought in Half-Life 2 – if you didn’t take them seriously as a threat before, it’s now impossible not to. The same otherworldly sound design that made the landscape of the gulag-like City 17 so memorable back in 2004 is in full effect here as well, and full-3D surround sound intensifies all of these recognizable pieces.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Aside from the new perspective, Alyx feels very much like a traditional Half-Life game. It’s set up as a linear series of areas, starting with a normal City 17 neighborhood and then moving underground, through industrial areas like a distillery, high-tech Combine facilities, slimy alien nests, and more. Each chapter of the 15-hour campaign feels substantially different from the last, including one that relies heavily on an unkillable antagonist you have to work your way around, and some that are all but pitch black except for your wrist-mounted flashlight.

                                            Combat is a major part of the journey, but so is puzzle-solving. Some hacking puzzles pop up when you go to unlock various Combine technology. None of them are terribly complex – for instance, there’s a memory-matching game where you connect points on a holographic sphere and a very cool-looking one where you trace the path of electricity through a wall and rotate connectors in a power-flow puzzle – but all of them make heavy use of VR’s ability to work in three dimensions, and some of them actually get tricky when they scale up in the later levels. Disarming tripwire mines by tracing a path through rings as a burning fuse chases you – while being careful not to accidentally trip the mine with your hand – can get fairly intense.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Gleaming pucks of resin (the currency you use to upgrade your weapons at special stations), ammunition, grenades, and health injectors are scattered throughout the levels, almost to a ridiculous degree. It’s a little immersion-breaking to find items even when they make no sense to be there – like, why would a pistol mag and a hand grenade be stashed in an office filing cabinet? – but it’s necessary given the large number of hits to the face Combine soldiers can take before we get that familiar flatline sound effect. Like an Easter egg hunt, many of these items are placed in plain sight and meant for everybody to find, but I found that careful exploration after clearing out an area was nearly always rewarded. Valve’s level designers apparently delight in cleverly placing items where they’re hidden from view if you’re walking through a level from beginning to end but very obvious when going backwards.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            My only issue with Half-Life: Alyx’s gunfights is that the heavily armored Combine soldier type can be boring to fight. They’re virtually always the last ones standing once you’ve taken out their smarter and more mobile escorts who throw grenades to force you out of cover, and that leaves you to simply plink away at them as they stand in the open until they start to spin up their miniguns. Then you take cover, wait for them to exhaust their magazine, and repeat until they fall down.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Just like in previous Half-Life games, you have to move around a whole lot in Half-Life: Alyx, and there are several options that allow for everything from playing seated to room-scale immersion (and even a one-handed mode). As an individual blessed with a strong stomach and a coffee table I can move out of the way to create a decent-sized area, I played exclusively standing and moving, with the free movement controls instead of teleportation. With these, you can use the left thumbstick to walk around like you would in any first-person game, using the right thumbstick to make quick, 45-degree turns for when I didn’t want to get tangled up in the headset cord. You do have to “jump” gaps from time to time, but pulling down on the right stick lets you point at a target and release to teleport there as though you’d actually performed a feat of athleticism. That’s also useful for if you don’t want to crouch under barriers yourself (though that’s certainly an option) and for when you might get stuck on terrain.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Back when VR first became a real thing and we all started spitballing which game worlds we’d most like to be fully immersed in, Half-Life topped my list (tied with BioShock). It took a few years, but Half-Life: Alyx has more than realized that potential. With it, Valve has set a new bar for VR in interactivity, detail, and level design, showing what can happen when a world-class developer goes all-in on the new frontier of technology. In a lot of ways, it feels like a game from the future, and one that the rest of VR gaming will likely take a good long while to match, much less surpass.

                                            A turn-based grand strategy game on the scale of Total War: Three Kingdoms often struggles to present a consistent and meaningful challenge across hundreds of turns and dozens of battles. With this foray into ancient China, however, Creative Assembly seems to have finally hit an elusive sweet spot with its campaign tuning. A political and tactical landscape that’s almost never boring, filled out with gorgeous, stylized graphics, an excellent character system, and massive performance improvements over previous games in the series leave no doubt who the new emperor is around these parts.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Three Kingdoms offers you two ways to conquer its sprawling, attractively exaggerated map of 200s CE China. Records mode is closer to classic historical Total War, where generals are mere mortals accompanied into battle by a bodyguard regiment, and real-time engagements play out slowly and less decisively. It also led me to feel like I might as well be playing any other historical Total War game, though. That’s not a deal-breaker given how many other things are fresh and exciting on the campaign map, but I was never all that tempted to give it much of my time when the other option is so much cooler.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The campaign really comes alive in Romance mode, which is based on the semi-historical novel about the era, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This turns your generals into demigod-like kung fu action heroes who engage in dramatic duels and can take on hundreds of normal soldiers single-handedly. Both modes put a strong emphasis on the larger-than-life characters driving the action, including quippy banter both before and during battle that helps bring them to life. But some of the fun and character is definitely lost if you’re sticking closer to the history books in Records mode.

                                            Spotlighting named characters helps make up for the fact that the armies themselves aren’t quite as diverse or interesting as, say, the Warhammer Total Wars’ or even Thrones of Britannia’s. We’re back in the land of swordsmen, spearmen, archers, and cavalry in various configurations maneuvering to best exploit the rock-paper-scissors relationships between different troops. And there aren’t competing ethnic groups to shake things up on the level of Huns vs Romans in Attila since all the action takes place between factions that are decidedly Chinese. Diversity in army composition is encouraged in other ways, however, as troops are recruited to a specific character’s retinue and armies are made up of one to three of them. Also, each general has a class, so you’ll want to compose forces around complementary generals with regiments that take the best advantage of their bonuses.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            One of the cleverest ways the campaign maintains this pressure is by having all of the minor warlords coalesce into the titular Three Kingdoms in the late game. Once you become powerful enough to stake a claim on the Imperial throne, your two most dangerous remaining rivals will do the same and morph the field from a chaotic free-for-all to a three-way Mexican standoff from which only one ruler can emerge victorious. It provides the same great escalation in tension as the Realm Divide mechanic from Total War Shogun 2, but without arbitrarily handing half of your hard-won provinces to rebels.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Not all of the new campaign mechanics are so flashy and impactful, though. There’s a whole system of ministries, governorships, and assignments you can slot characters into that grant bonuses to your faction, but I found that I mostly forgot they existed most of the time. Their greatest benefit seems to come from giving a discontented character a fancy title so they don’t ragequit and go join another warlord. The bonuses are nice, but most of them come simply from having any given butt in the right chair. Bonuses from individual characters’ butts are relatively meager and ignorable. Assignments in particular, which are meant to give your characters who aren’t actively governing or leading an army something to do, could have completely disappeared and I probably wouldn’t have noticed. There’s no notification for when assignment slots are available, so unless I made a point of checking their menu every turn I really only used them if there was a crisis, like a food shortage, and I needed a way to shore it up quickly.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The gold dragon ornament on top of all of this is that Three Kingdoms runs like an absolute dream. Every Total War game since 2013’s Rome 2 has had significant performance issues, even on high-end hardware. But much to my surprise, both the campaign map and the battles glided along like a crane on the wind without even making my GeForce GTX 1070 and i7-4770K break a sweat – even on Ultra settings. As a baseline, I was getting almost 50% higher framerates on the battle map than the recent Thrones of Britannia. I still saw some slowdowns in absolutely titanic clashes involving multiple full-sized armies beefing apocalyptically over a massive, fortified city, but not to the same degree that I’m used to with this series.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Total War: Three Kingdoms should serve as the example for all games of its breed going forward. The campaign design is brilliant, full of character, and tells a cohesive, historical-feeling story with satisfying act breaks and unexpected turns of fortune. The improvements to performance and optimization over its predecessors almost make me want to just lean back in my chair and hum contentedly while I watch hundreds of peasant militia hack each other to pieces. Its relentless ability to constantly provide challenging battles can almost seem like too much of a good thing sometimes, but it’s still a huge improvement over what came before. Just remember when you’re going over resumes to decide who to bring on to lead your next, big offensive: Do not pursue Lu Bu.

                                            There’s an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player. “Welcome to Dota 2!” They say, with open arms, before concluding with, “You suck.” They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that, after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a massive brawl where both teams of five colorful fantasy characters collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre. Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified. It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            As such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. That sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but there’s method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities like Bloodseeker’s Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 102 heroes (and counting) fits you best is a time-consuming challenge.

                                            Even after all that, to avoid being caught at a disadvantage you must be taught the nuanced techniques that can make or break games, which Dota 2 seems to almost belligerently hide from new players. Tricks like pulling a group of neutral monsters out of their home so that a new group can spawn to effectively double the rewards are never hinted at. This forced me to read and educate my outside of Dota 2, which had the positive effect of introducing me to the player community and making me feel like a part of it. It's almost like an oral tradition that binds together a tribe.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            In my personal experience, Valve’s ideas work. I've played for over 1,000 hours, and my encounters with people unwilling to act decently towards their fellow players have become increasingly rare over the course of Dota 2’s development. It has never been more friendly than it is now – though that’s a relative comparison. Even with these enhancements, the best way to play Dota 2 will always be with a team of four friends.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Valve’s dogged desire to preserve DOTA's design perfectly is a double-edged sword in some ways. There are a few design choices that feel needlessly archaic and slavish to the original, such as the way Blink Dagger will arbitrarily shave 200 units of movement from your blink if you overestimate the distance, or how the towers will occasionally refuse to acknowledge your attempts to turn aggro away from yourself during a siege. They feel like relics of previous era, traditions carried on for the sake of tradition.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            As for its future prospects, things look bright for Dota 2. Each year of its long beta period is defined by huge balance patches that make widespread changes to keep things fresh and interesting. Given Valve’s excellent ongoing support of Team Fortress 2, its other free-to-play game, it’s a safe bet that there will always be something to learn and something new to master for the foreseeable future. Patches are released on a weekly basis, and on any given day there are multiple professional games to watch. Even the cosmetics are constantly changing, with community chests and themed events occurring regularly throughout the year. Dota 2 isn’t static in any sense of the word, from the wild variety of each game to the overarching sense that it will never be finished being made.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.

                                            It was one of the first big free-to-play games, and one of the first big multiplayer online battle arenas, or MOBAs. But going on five years later, League of Legends still holds firm as an example of excellence. With its amazing variety of Champions, rewarding progression systems, and fast but intensely strategic team play, it easily hooked me and refused to let go. That addictiveness and competitive spirit, combined with a generous free-to-play approach and frequent updates from developer Riot Games, has created one of the biggest and liveliest gaming communities anywhere.

                                            Like most MOBAs, League of Legends’ main attraction is its five-on-five matches on its staple three-lane map. Called Summoner's Rift, this map is brightly and colorfully designed, and it creates a distinct playstyle with the way its dense brush allows you to conceal yourself and surprise enemies. I particularly love how the distinctive jungles on either side of the central river are filled with NPC monsters that give buffs to players who take a break from battle to go on the hunt – it’s a constant temptation to risk venturing into the other team’s territory to attempt to steal their buffs. The choice between engaging the other team directly or attacking their resources allows for interesting strategies and depth beyond simply fighting until one Champion or turret is dead.

                                            Inside each team's base also lies an Inhibitor which, if destroyed, causes the opposing team’s side to start spawning super minions. It’s an extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base, and having one more building to take down often leads to exciting and game-ending team fights.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            From Ziggs, the bomb-loving little rat, to Jinx, the blue-pigtailed maniac, it’s electrifying to coordinate with your team to mow down your opponents and push lanes with League’s characterful and cartoony Champions. They each have an innate passive ability that helps make them more dynamic without increasing the already-complex management of active abilities. Teemo’s passive Camouflage power, for example, is a great way to sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. Plus, the quirky things they say and their flashy active abilities make the Champions memorable. I can’t help but laugh every time the adorable Lulu says, "Yep! That tasted purple!"

                                            As free-to-play games go, League of Legends is a model of generosity. Though it doesn’t give everything away like Dota 2 does, it serves up a weekly rotating selection of 10 Champions for free, and you can purchase and play with any of the 117-character roster for a reasonable price of between two and eight dollars each. Yes, that adds up to a princely sum if you intend to buy every single character, but there’s no need to buy more than you intend to actually play. The Champion rotation is a nice way to try before you buy, and helped me to pace myself by learning just a few characters at a time.

                                        <p>
                                            Where League of Legends really shines is on the competitive level. Once you reach level 30 (which took me about 160 wins), as long as you have 16 Champs earned or bought and have played some placement matches, you can compete in Ranked play with the most serious players. The fantastic ladder system ensures you’ll play against people on the same skill level (until periodic resets, and the process begins anew). Making your way up the ranks is a serious achievement, and knowing that ladder points are on the line makes the competition in every match even more fierce.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            At the other end of the spectrum, League’s excellent tutorial is gentle way to ease into MOBA mechanics, and its AI bot players give a judgement-free way of learning to play new characters. One major feature that’s missing, though, is a means of watching match replays to better learn from mistakes. Considering they're a great training tool in other MOBAs and competitive games of all genres, it's a shame they aren't included.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            When you need a break from Summoner’s Rift, there are other, faster-paced modes to choose from. Dominion and All Random All Mid (ARAM) are both quick, usually lasting about 25 minutes rather than 45 to 60. Using the Champions to sprint around a small map to capture points in Dominion is silly yet competitive, and ARAM forces everyone to use a random Champion on a one-lane map and is more about catching the other team off guard and pushing your advantage. I had a great time purchasing strange item combinations from the increased amount of gold you get in these modes, and the consistent action-packed brawls are a breath of fresh air relative to the slow and steady gold farming and item building of Summoner's Rift.

                                            While the gameplay is intensely fun and the Champions are fantastic, the main thing holding League of Legends back is its Adobe Air client. With such an incredible visual finesse throughout the entire stylized MOBA, it's unfortunate how dated the slow, buggy client is. The incredibly long load times are nice when you need a drink, but ultimately waiting two minutes before each game gets annoying. You can’t even change your in-game settings before you hop into a match. Updating the client and servers will take some incredible technical prowess, but they’re undoubtedly the weakest links of an otherwise very strong chain.

                                        <p>
                                            Even though you play on the same few maps with similar items, there’s so much depth and strategy going on that no two matches of League of Legends ever feel the same. It’s distinctive style encourages surprise attacks and frequent use of skill-shot powers, and its colorful art style makes everything pop on the screen. Learning how to make the most of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and challenging process, but once you’ve got it down, it’s incredibly satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing MOBA.

                                            You expect to see only fields of grazing deer and idle monsters but when you turn the corner, there’s chaos. Crowds crush together, jumping around and blasting spells and swinging huge weapons. You join in, and though all possibility for any real coordination is lost in the frenzy, a sense of community, of belonging, solidifies as everyone strives to destroy a shared target. In Guild Wars 2, ArenaNet builds these events into every single zone, teasing you to explore by instilling a sense that despite Tyria’s colossal size, another surprise isn’t far away.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            There’s no global player versus player combat in main zones where you’ll level up to the 80 cap. Like Turbine’s The Lord of the Rings Online, Guild Wars 2 establishes a friendly, inviting atmosphere by setting everyone on the same path to vanquish a seemingly invincible evil, and effectively removes many of the genre’s tedious restrictions on cooperation. There are no long lines to wait in, no cliques of high level players lording their seniority over the rest, no wristbands required to see the most interesting stuff, everyone can easily take part in the cyclical, world-spanning party.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            On each combat map are walled keeps and towers and relatively defenseless supply camps, all of which can be conquered and held to earn points for your side. While they can be taken by joining with a swarm of allies, they can also be easily lost if nobody on your side is paying attention to the details. Supply camps send out convoys that bring materials to all other structures, and these materials are required to build siege equipment like siege golems and battering rams and catapults and many others. Only a limited amount of supply can be carried by any one player, so teamwork is required to get anything built and operational. The effects of successfully building siege equipment are dramatic, allowing smaller teams to defend or greatly speed up an assault. Soon it’s obvious that running around in a warband striking out at everything within reach benefits nobody, and whatever success is found using such tactics can easily be cancelled out by an organized squad that’s attacking enemy supply convoys and blanketing hostile forces with arrow cart fire.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The result is a complex, nonstop battle characterized by huge swings in momentum that can be accessed at any time, where victory furthers a server’s sense of community and drives a powerful sense of competition between real players, which should ideally serve as a mark of pride for any guilds large and organized enough to use the WvW maps as proof of their superiority. Like much of the rest of Guild Wars 2, the fact that WvW is open to anyone does a lot to deemphasize the need to grind levels to see the most sophisticated content. You use and can actually level up your PvE character in WvW, gaining experience for kills, looting fallen enemies and earning skill points through challenges, making the mode feel like less of a random alternate gameplay style and more of a natural fit with the rest of the Guild Wars 2 experience.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            It’s also a major component of end game content, which also includes the explorable mode dungeons and pursuit of elaborately designed legendary items, which for the moment seems like enough. Though Guild Wars 2 contains many items, it’s not the style of game where having a powerful item determines success or failure. It’s more about skill in battle than never-ending statistical bloat, which is a refreshing alternative to MMOs that gate progress so severely based equipped weapons and armor. That may make the end game less interesting to some, but ArenaNet’s clearly of a different mind.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            This is not the type of game where the primary goal is to acquire god-like power and run across the world one-shotting everything in sight so the unworthy low-level masses can bow down and pay homage to your omnipotence. Instead, every zone and dungeon is level capped. Your level is scaled down upon entering lower level zones, ensuring you can still play the content instead of steamroll it, which makes exploration through areas you might have missed on your journey to 80 still feel meaningful. Thanks to a multitude of incentives to explore, such as a significant number of platforming challenges hidden throughout the world, revisiting old territory to see everything feels worthwhile. Admittedly, I kind of miss being able to obliterate enemies that used to pose a serious challenge, but ArenaNet’s solution also serves the purpose of ensuring zone events aren’t wrecked by high level players, so the trade-off feels justified.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            ArenaNet has built one of the most exhaustively detailed and rewarding MMOs in existence, one that never unfairly penalizes and fosters an incredible urge to explore through a generous reward system and achingly pretty environment design. It’s a virtual world that more than anything wants you to work together with others, and provides a huge number of possibilities for cooperation while minimizing restrictions. For those disappointed in the lack of open world PvP, the World versus World alternative is a fascinating, complex system that demands teamwork, and the arena PvP modes should provide an instant-fix for those who thrive on fast, adrenaline-fueled combat. Whether you’re looking for competitive play, want to be told a story or simply want to go for a walk through fantastic countryside, Guild Wars 2 lets you do it all with a minimal amount of arbitrary, irritating limitations, and all without a subscription fee.

                                            Age of Empires 3 is the weirdest of the old-school RTS series – a game that, back in 2005, radically departed from the others for a different feel. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition gives it new life, changing some things that begged to be changed and bringing the production values up to a much higher standard. It's the Age of Empires update that will be least appreciated, but most needed, a remaster that adds new single-player missions and civilizations. It gives AoE 3's unique twists on the RTS a new life. It also serves as a pretty sharp reminder that this is the most obtuse game in the series, because most of its clever tricks aren't half as good as it thinks they are.

                                            Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition edition upgrades graphics, colors, and textures across the board, all the way up to 4K resolutions. The remade Home City screens are characterful renditions of cities from Amsterdam to Tenochtitlan, with stops in Beijing and Berlin along the way. It ran pretty well on my AMD 8350 and GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, with occasional hitching on eight-player matches and a handful of isolated crashes. A surprising bonus is how the remastered soundtrack vastly improves the music, with richer bass filling out the horns and strings. In fact, after a few hours I realized that the Age of Empires 3 take on the main theme absolutely slaps. It's my new favorite from the series soundtracks.

                                        <p>
                                            The other sound effects and voice acting are improved but not up to the level you’d expect from any given modern game. There are two notable exceptions to that: A pre-Mass Effect fame Jennifer Hale as Lizzie in the campaign, and the redone or entirely new voice acting in campaign and historical scenarios. (Everyone other than whoever did Gustavus Adolphus. All due respect to the greatest of the Swedes, but he’s horrible.)
                                        </p>

                                            Underneath that updated exterior, Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition remains as hardcore an economy-focused RTS as the others in the series. To be competitive in multiplayer you have to micromanage and and flawlessly execute economic plans, tasking and re-tasking your settlers to hunt game, chop trees, and mine silver with maximum efficiency. (There's no Stone in AoE 3.) There’s a lot of plates to keep spinning as you build a sprawling base to take over the map, including fortifications like walls and guard towers, all while carefully timing big spends of resources to advance from one age to the next, unlocking new technologies, buildings, and units as you go.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Age of Empires 3's early modern setting means there's a lot more ranged combat than other Age games since guns are around from the jump. You still have the standard Melee/Ranged, Infantry/Cavalry, and Light/Heavy distinctions, but there are more complex unit types like skirmishers or stealthy ambushers, not to mention hero units in the mix as well. Plus the impact of mobile, area-of-effect field artillery really changes fights, requiring specific counter-units to take down. Castles and towers are less numerous, but those that do exist are more powerful: Fortresses bristle with guns and cannons.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The biggest twist in Age of Empires 3 is that your base doesn’t stand alone, but serves as a colony of some distant nation. A system of Home City Cards allows you to bring in shipments of troops, new technologies, and resources as you defeat enemy units and gain experience. You get to choose which 25 cards you have available by making decks before matches start. (Thankfully, the old Home City levelling system has changed. You have every card available to you at the start—no more getting stomped just because someone else has unlocked the good cards. Levelling up your home city is only for cosmetics now.)
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The old interface is nigh-unplayable compared to a modern RTS, but the new one both works and comes in three versions. The UI overhaul probably does the most to bring Age of Empires 3 up to modern standards, floating on top of things rather than obscuring half the action. It's nothing fancy, but it works… and it includes some egregiously awful color choices. Brilliant pure yellow and white text on a faux-wood brown background is the biggest and most consistent offender. It's eye strain-inducing.

                                            However, accessibility features are here to save the day: You can simply remap all identifying player and text colors to any other color. I'm glad someone was paying attention to StarCraft 2's way of doing things.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is a bold attempt to remaster the most controversial game in a series. The funky experimental RTS at the core of AoE 3 is intact, but it's still just that: Weird. Like a stinky cheese, it just can't appeal to everyone. The new graphics, UI, sound, and content make it much more fun to play and will win converts among those who are trying it for the first time. The rest was harder to update, and though it's better than it was, the single-player scenarios will never be half as fun as multiplayer matches.
