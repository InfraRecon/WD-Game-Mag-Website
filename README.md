# WD-Game-Mag-Website

This is a Template Website I made During my Studies, I aimed to put as many Effects and Learn as Much as I could while making this site, feel free to Download and learn from this, just remember to Credit me if you use this for anything useful.

I took a look at websites such as Playstation, XBOX and Nintendo to learn how big companies make thos sleek looking Websites.

If you like this and want to contact me about potential business, trust me I've grown after making this, then you'll just have to find me yourself. 
The internet is a big place and I like to keep to myself, but when you do find me I'll at least know you're interested and I'll take your claim Seriosly.

Enjoy :)
